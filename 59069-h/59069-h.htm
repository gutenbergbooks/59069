<p>Bent Arrow drove himself forward with all
his strength. For a few steps he seemed to
be closing the gap between himself and the
two older boys ahead. The next moment the
old pain beat up through his right leg. He had
to choke back a gasp as he nearly stumbled.</p>
<p>He forced himself to keep running, although
the pain had slowed him so much that
the two ahead were rapidly outdistancing him.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Sly Fox and
Laughing Deer draw even with him and try to
pass. In spite of the pain in his leg, Bent
Arrow wasn&rsquo;t going to be last. He lunged
forward, barely managing to cross the finish
line ahead of the other two.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>As soon as he had crossed the line, Bent
Arrow turned toward the crowd of warriors
surrounding the winner. The warriors were
so close to the runner that Bent Arrow
couldn&rsquo;t see who it was. Then he caught sight
of Running Elk standing at one side, so he
knew that Lone Eagle was the winner.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow saw his uncle, Flying Arrow,
at the edge of the circle of warriors. He turned
in that direction. He had to grit his teeth to
keep from limping, but he was determined
that his uncle shouldn&rsquo;t think he was using
his injured leg as an excuse for not winning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you have to be ashamed because
I can&rsquo;t win a race,&rdquo; Bent Arrow said as soon
as he was beside his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ashamed!&rdquo; Flying Arrow exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not ashamed. I&rsquo;m proud that you were able
to beat two runners as good as Sly Fox and
Laughing Deer. Running Elk and Lone Eagle
are a summer older than you. When you are
in your fourteenth summer, you will be an
even better runner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Bent Arrow gulped and bent his head.
Only girls cried. Certainly a boy of thirteen
summers didn&rsquo;t, but Flying Arrow&rsquo;s unexpected
praise had brought tears very close to
Bent Arrow&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When your leg is completely healed, you&rsquo;ll
be one of the best runners in the whole Crow
Nation,&rdquo; Flying Arrow went on. &ldquo;You are
much improved since your last race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep practicing,&rdquo; Bent Arrow vowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clawing Bear wants to see you,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow told him.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow glanced at his uncle&rsquo;s face. He
could see nothing there to tell him what the
medicine man wanted. Was he to hear bad
news about his leg? He would have liked to
ask Flying Arrow why the medicine man
wanted to see him, but Crow boys were not
expected to ask questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go now,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>He turned from his uncle and went past the
warriors who were still gathered around Lone
Eagle, and on toward the camp. It wasn&rsquo;t a
large camp. There were only about twenty
tepees, set up in two irregular lines. This was
a hunting party out to lay in a supply of buffalo
meat for the winter which was not too far
away. The hunters had brought their squaws
along. The women would take care of curing
and drying the meat that the hunters brought.</p>
<p>The medicine man&rsquo;s tepee was the last one
in the back row and was placed a little apart
from the others. Clawing Bear was sitting in
front of his tepee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Bent Arrow,&rdquo; Clawing Bear invited,
getting slowly to his feet.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow followed the medicine man into
the tepee. Clawing Bear sat near the fire and
motioned Bent Arrow to sit beside him. The
boy sat quietly while the medicine man selected
a pipe, filled it, and lighted it with a
brand from the fire. Clawing Bear inhaled
deeply, and slowly blew the smoke to the east.
After a pause, he took a second puff and blew
it to the south. In the same way he blew smoke
to the west and to the north. Then he laid the
pipe aside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;You ran a good race today,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were watching,&rdquo; Bent
Arrow answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t miss many races,&rdquo; Clawing Bear
replied with a smile. &ldquo;I am pleased that you
are running better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your treatment is making my leg better,&rdquo;
Bent Arrow explained. &ldquo;That is why I am able
to run faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is about your leg that I wanted to talk
with you,&rdquo; Clawing Bear told him.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow held himself as motionless as
possible while the medicine man again filled
the pipe and again blew smoke in the directions
of the four winds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you were very small, only in your
second summer,&rdquo; Clawing Bear finally began,
&ldquo;your parents took you with a hunting party
like this one. One day, when most of the hunters
were gone, the Sioux attacked the camp.
There were not enough Crow warriors in
camp to protect it. When Flying Arrow and
the other hunters returned, they found the
camp destroyed and, apparently, everyone in
it slain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The medicine man stared silently at the fire
for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was while the hunters were holding the
death ceremonies for our people,&rdquo; Clawing
Bear resumed, &ldquo;that Flying Arrow found you.
Your right leg was badly injured. Your uncle
set it as carefully as he could. Several Crow
warriors looked at you. Each of them shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It would be better for the small boy to
follow his parents to the Happy Hunting
Grounds,&rsquo; one of the warriors told your uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clawing Bear stopped and looked at Bent
Arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lot of a cripple is bad,&rdquo; he said
gruffly.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow nodded without speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shall take him to my friend, Clawing
Bear, the medicine man,&rsquo; your uncle told
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did. I have given you every treatment
handed down by Crow medicine men since
the Great Spirit walked on earth and taught
warriors how to live. Your uncle has seen that
you have had every needed exercise. Today
you outran two fine racers. The Great Spirit
has been kind to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am grateful to you and my uncle, too,&rdquo;
Bent Arrow said. &ldquo;How can I ever repay you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are completely cured, we shall
be repaid,&rdquo; Clawing Bear answered.</p>
<p>Apparently the medicine man had completed
his story, but he didn&rsquo;t make the sign of
dismissal. Bent Arrow waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had a medicine dream about you,&rdquo;
Clawing Bear resumed. &ldquo;Not all of it was clear.
However, there will be trouble with the Sioux.
You and Flying Arrow will be in great danger.
There was something about an eagle or an
eagle feather, it wasn&rsquo;t clear which. Yet I saw
you running swiftly. I saw that your leg was
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow&rsquo;s face glowed. He hardly heard
the words about danger. The medicine man&rsquo;s
dream meant that he would be well. Already
he could see himself winning a great race and
earning a new name much better than Bent
Arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;How are you doing with your swimming
lessons?&rdquo; Clawing Bear interrupted his
thoughts.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow shivered at the memory of the
morning&rsquo;s icy dip. There hadn&rsquo;t actually been
ice on the water, but there had been frost on
the grass along the path to the river. Crow boys
were required to swim every day until the ice
on the river was too thick to be broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swim well,&rdquo; Bent Arrow explained, &ldquo;but
my diving isn&rsquo;t very good. The other boys
ducked me again this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clawing Bear nodded understandingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep practicing,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be
long until you dive well enough so that the
boys will have no excuse to duck you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it is so hard for me to
learn to do things,&rdquo; Bent Arrow said, with a
touch of complaint in his voice. &ldquo;My uncle
does everything well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle learned the same way you are
learning,&rdquo; Clawing Bear answered sharply.
&ldquo;Every Crow is expected to do his best. See
that you are a good Crow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; Bent Arrow promised.</p>
<p>Clawing Bear made the sign of dismissal.
Bent Arrow got to his feet and stepped out of
the tepee. He looked about the camp to see
what the other boys were doing. There were
two younger boys playing near one of the
tepees, but Bent Arrow could see none of the
boys of his own age. He remembered that they
had planned to hunt rabbits. He knew where
they would be hunting, but it was too late to
join them. The sun was so warm that Bent
Arrow decided this would be a good time to
practice diving. He hurried through the camp
and along the path to the river.</p>
<p>Usually, the chief in charge of a hunting
party selected a place along the river for a
camp. Chief Barking Wolf had chosen a place
near a spring and back a short distance from
the river. Bent Arrow went to the top of the
low hill which was between the camp and the
river. As soon as he was at the top of the hill,
he began to run. He raced to the riverbank,
leaped high, and dived into the water. It was
a clean dive, barely making a splash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I dive that well tomorrow, the other
boys won&rsquo;t get to duck me,&rdquo; he thought, as he
rose to the surface.</p>
<p>He climbed out of the river, went up the
hill, and again made a running dive. This
was a good dive, too. He climbed up onto the
bank and rested. The camp swimming teacher
had been urging the boys to practice swimming
under water. Bent Arrow decided that
he would make one more practice dive. If it
proved as good as the others, he would see how
far he could swim under water.</p>
<p>To make the practice more fun, he pretended
that he was escaping from enemies.
When he was ready to dive, he bent low and
ran as hard as he could. His dive carried him
well out into the river. He knifed into the
water with no more splash than a jumping fish
would have made. He held his breath and
swam under water with the current. He stayed
under until it seemed his lungs would burst.
At last he let his head rise above the surface
enough so that he could breathe. While he
gulped fresh air, Bent Arrow&rsquo;s eyes were measuring
the distance he had covered. He had
swum much farther under water than he had
supposed he could. Keeping up his game of
escape, he sank below the surface again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The next time he was forced to raise his
head, he found that he was below the first
bend. That was almost as well as a warrior
could do. He noticed a clump of brush overhanging
the river near him. If he really were a
warrior trying to escape from enemies, that
would be the place to leave the water. He
swam toward the shore and managed to grasp
one of the low-hanging branches. Carefully he
pulled himself out of the water onto the bank.
He crept behind the clump of brush and
stretched out to rest.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow lay still, letting the sun warm
and dry him. As long as he pretended that
enemies were following him, it was easy for
him to lie quiet. Suddenly he heard a faint
splash which sounded as though it might be
near the other bank of the river. He was almost
certain that the splash had been made by a
jumping fish, but an escaping warrior would
neglect no precaution. Cautiously Bent Arrow
raised his head until he could see between the
branches of the sheltering bush. He jerked
his head down as suddenly as though he were
ducking an arrow. He had seen a Sioux warrior
bending down to drink on the other side
of the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<div class="img" id="pic1">

<p class="caption"><i>Bent Arrow raised his head until he could see</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Bent Arrow knew that he must carry a warning
to camp. Sioux warriors this near a Crow
camp meant danger. He turned his head
enough to look at the wide space of sand which
divided his hiding place from the shelter of the
trees. If he tried to dart across there, the Sioux
warrior was sure to see him.</p>
<p>Carefully he raised his head again to look
across the river. Now there were three Sioux
drinking at the river, and one standing behind
them looking straight at Bent Arrow.
Bent Arrow had to fight down the impulse to
jump and run for camp. If the Sioux hadn&rsquo;t
already seen him, a sudden movement would
reveal him. Evidently the Sioux hadn&rsquo;t noticed
him. The warrior&rsquo;s glance passed on along the
riverbank. A moment later the three Indians
got to their feet, and all four of them slipped
silently into the brush which lined that side of
the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Bent Arrow watched until his neck muscles
became so cramped that he had to move.
Slowly he lowered his head and stretched out
flat. When the pain in his neck had stopped,
he again raised his head and looked across the
river. All of the time that he watched the other
shore, he was torn between the fear that he was
delaying too long and the fear that if he moved
too soon the Sioux would see him. At last he
decided it was time for him to start.</p>
<p>Slowly he edged away from the sheltering
clump of brush. He kept flat on his stomach
and wriggled across the wide stretch of sand.
When he reached the trees, he crawled a short
distance among them. Then he got to his feet
and dashed to the Crow camp. He raced
straight to the tepee of his uncle.</p>
<p>The flap of the tepee was pulled shut. Flying
Arrow was asleep or he was making medicine.
A Crow warrior should not be disturbed,
but Bent Arrow knew that his message was too
important to be delayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; he called urgently, &ldquo;there are
Sioux warriors on the other bank of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Before Bent Arrow had finished speaking,
Flying Arrow stepped out of the tepee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo; Flying Arrow asked.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow held up his right hand with the
thumb doubled under.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all I saw,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;They
were at the first bend of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; Flying Arrow ordered and
trotted off along the line of tepees.</p>
<p>A few moments later, Flying Arrow led a
small band of warriors out of camp. Before
that band had gone far, a party of mounted
warriors, with Chief Barking Wolf at the head,
rode out of camp circling toward the land of
the setting sun.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow waited impatiently for word
of the pursuit. There was some excitement in
camp when the two scouts who had been sent
out early that morning returned with the report
that they had found a large herd of buffaloes.
For a while Bent Arrow forgot his
worries and spent his time wondering if he
would be allowed to go with the hunters.
However, as the afternoon wore on, all of his
thoughts were on the warriors who were chasing
the Sioux.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The sun was almost down when the two
parties of warriors returned to camp. Flying
Arrow came straight to his own tepee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They escaped,&rdquo; he told Bent Arrow. &ldquo;They
had horses hidden not far from the river. They
heard us coming and got too great a start for
our warriors to catch them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they be back to try to steal our
horses?&rdquo; Bent Arrow asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly not,&rdquo; Flying Arrow replied.
&ldquo;Sioux like to make winter camp early. That
party may start toward their main camp now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Bent Arrow and his uncle were eating
their evening meal, a messenger came to
the tepee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is to be a buffalo hunt tomorrow,&rdquo;
the messenger announced. &ldquo;Bent Arrow has
been chosen to help tend the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow was so excited at the messenger&rsquo;s
words that he could scarcely finish his
supper. Although the boys who tended the
pack horses during a hunt had a difficult time,
there was always a chance that they would get
to take part in the hunting, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better crawl into your robes and get
a good night&rsquo;s rest,&rdquo; Flying Arrow suggested.
&ldquo;Tomorrow will be an exciting day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow expected to find it hard to fall
asleep, but it wasn&rsquo;t long after he had crawled
into his robes before he dozed off. Soon his
sleep was disturbed by a dream. In his dream
he and another boy were chasing a buffalo.
The other boy rode alongside the buffalo and
was drawing his bow for a shot when his horse
stumbled. The boy was thrown in front of the
charging buffalo. Bent Arrow tried to cry out
a warning, and, in trying to call out, he awoke.
He immediately told his uncle of his dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to the medicine man,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow said, after a thoughtful silence. &ldquo;It
must be a warning of some kind. I&rsquo;m sure
Clawing Bear will understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow again dropped off to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c2"><br /><i>CHAPTER TWO</i></h2>
<p>Bent Arrow was awake early the next
morning. He crawled out of his buffalo
robes and dressed quickly. There was a little
twinge of pain in his right leg, but he knew
that would be gone as soon as he had walked a
few paces. He was eager for the swimming
teacher to give the call for practice. He was
sure that today he would dive as well as any of
the boys.</p>
<p>When he stepped out of the tepee, he lost
some of his eagerness. There was a light covering
of snow on the ground. Before he had a
chance really to worry about how cold the
water would be, Bent Arrow heard the call of
the teacher and saw the boys forming a line.
He trotted over and took his place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>When it was Bent Arrow&rsquo;s turn to dive, he
dashed forward, leaped high, and went into the
water with scarcely a splash. He came up gasping
and sputtering, but smiling. He had made
a good dive. He wouldn&rsquo;t be ducked today.</p>
<p>Sly Fox was the only boy to make a poor
dive. Four boys grabbed him and shoved his
head under water. Fortunately for Sly Fox, all
of the boys were eager to get out of the cold
water. They let him up almost at once. As
soon as the last boy had dived, the teacher dismissed
them. Bent Arrow was glad to get out
of the cold water and race back to the tepee.</p>
<p>As soon as they had eaten, Bent Arrow and
his uncle went to the corral. Flying Arrow
caught his best buffalo horse to ride on the
hunt. Bent Arrow hoped that he would be
given one of the faster horses, too. Instead,
Flying Arrow caught Rock, one of the oldest
and slowest of his horses, for Bent Arrow to
ride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rock is dependable,&rdquo; Flying Arrow explained.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll make your work easier and
safer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow mounted Rock and helped his
uncle drive two other horses out of the herd to
be used as pack animals. Other boys and warriors
were busy at the same task. For a time
there was great confusion as the riders worked
to drive the horses they wanted and at the
same time make sure none of the others got
out of the corral. As soon as Flying Arrow&rsquo;s
two horses were out of the corral, Bent Arrow
was left to watch them while the warrior went
back to help the others.</p>
<p>Even after all of the horses to be used were
out of the corral, it was considerable work to
hold them together in a herd. At last the pack
horses were quiet enough so that the party
could start. Chief Barking Wolf ordered the
warriors to watch the horses while he gave the
boys their instructions. At his signal the boys
gathered around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each of you is to be given one good hunting
arrow,&rdquo; he told them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The boys exchanged triumphant glances.
They had been afraid that they would be given
the job of watching the pack horses all of the
time and wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to hunt. The
leader&rsquo;s next words brought looks of disappointment
to the boys&rsquo; faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to keep the arrows as proof that
you have been on a buffalo hunt,&rdquo; Chief Barking
Wolf continued, &ldquo;but you are to do no
hunting. A dream has warned us that the
Great Spirit does not want boys to hunt buffaloes
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow was given an arrow by one of
the warriors, while other warriors handed arrows
to each of the other boys. If he hadn&rsquo;t
been so badly disappointed about not being
allowed to hunt, Bent Arrow would have been
highly elated at receiving the arrow. It was a
fine one, probably the best one in the warrior&rsquo;s
quiver. There was a sharp stone head on it,
and the arrow had been carefully balanced.
Even a poor hunter should be able to kill a
buffalo with so fine an arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>When each boy had received his arrow,
Chief Barking Wolf sent them back to watch
the pack horses. The warriors fell into line behind
the leader, each one in the place that had
been assigned to him. As soon as all were
ready, Chief Barking Wolf rode to the head
of the party and led toward the rising sun.</p>
<p>It was now that Rock proved Flying Arrow&rsquo;s
wisdom in selecting him for Bent Arrow. The
pack horses seemed to want to go anywhere
except where the warriors were going. First
one horse would try to break out of the herd
and then another. Every time one tried to
break away, Rock was there to head him off.
He acted as though he could guess when a
horse was going to try to get away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was feeling sorry for you when Flying
Arrow gave you Rock to ride,&rdquo; Sly Fox admitted.
&ldquo;Now I see that you are lucky he did.
Rock is making the work easier for all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time the boys had to give all of their
attention to controlling the herd of pack
horses. But, by the time the party was well out
of sight of the camp, Rock had so discouraged
the would-be runaways that the whole herd
was moving steadily after the warriors. This
gave the boys a chance to ride in pairs and talk
together, as the sun climbed steadily in the
sky and melted the thin blanket of snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;The sun is mad at Old-Man-of-the-North
for sending snow so early,&rdquo; Bent Arrow told
Sly Fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sly Fox agreed. &ldquo;He has taken away
all of the snow. The sun is powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old-Man-of-the-North is tricky,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
remarked. &ldquo;Sometimes he sends snow
when we aren&rsquo;t ready for it. Other times he
won&rsquo;t send it when we want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that he sends much snow as soon
as we have plenty of buffalo meat and are in
our winter camp,&rdquo; Sly Fox exclaimed. &ldquo;We
need snow for our winter games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow nodded his agreement. Indian
boys always had fun, but winter was the best
time for games. It was a good time to learn
new things, too. The warriors had leisure to
teach the boys how to make bows and arrows.
There were always stories to be told of battles
and great heroes.</p>
<p>The sun was not yet overhead when Chief
Barking Wolf stopped the hunting party in a
small valley. He pointed to the low hills ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;The herd of buffaloes is in a large valley
across those hills,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;The hunters
will ride across the hills and you boys will
stay here with the pack horses. Wild Wind will
be the last warrior. He will stay at the top of
the hill until the rest of us have started to run
the buffaloes. Then he will signal for you boys
to bring the pack horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the warriors rode ahead, the boys were
kept busy holding the pack horses in a herd.
It was almost as much work keeping the herd
from following now as it had been before to
get it started. Sometimes, when one of the pack
horses broke out of the herd, Bent Arrow was
tempted to pretend that he couldn&rsquo;t turn it
back. If he let the horse go to the top of the
hill, Bent Arrow would be where he could
watch all of the excitement of the hunt. He
was ashamed of the thought. A Crow boy who
expected to become a warrior should do his
best to carry out orders.</p>
<p>Rock seemed to realize that it was up to him
to keep his rider from trouble. The horse
worked even harder than he had before. It
wasn&rsquo;t long until the pack animals realized
that they couldn&rsquo;t escape as long as Rock was
watching them. They quieted and began to
graze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Sly Fox rode over beside Bent Arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ride over there and shoot a
buffalo,&rdquo; Sly Fox told Bent Arrow, speaking
low so the other boys couldn&rsquo;t hear him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; Bent Arrow warned. &ldquo;Chief
Barking Wolf will have you punished. You
know how warriors are punished when they
disobey orders on a hunting trip. You will be
whipped in front of the whole camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The punishment will be forgotten if I kill
a buffalo,&rdquo; Sly Fox retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t&mdash;,&rdquo; Bent Arrow began, but at
that moment Wild Wind gave the signal for
the boys to bring the pack horses.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow and Sly Fox were in front of the
herd. They turned their horses and led the
way. The horses followed readily. At the top
of the low hill, the boys paused to watch the
hunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>From their place, the boys could see far out
over the wide valley. Truly the scouts had
found a great herd of buffaloes. The attack of
the hunters had started the herd running, but
even yet a fourth of the valley was covered
with buffaloes lumbering in flight ahead of
the hunters. Many lay where the hunters&rsquo; arrows
had slain them.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow noticed that the hunters were
riding into the herd, selecting the younger
animals. As the boys watched, one old buffalo
broke from the herd, turned back, and started
running up the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my chance to get a buffalo,&rdquo; Sly Fox
shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; Bent Arrow warned. &ldquo;We are
forbidden to hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Sly Fox heard the warning, he was too
excited to heed it. He kicked his heels against
his horse&rsquo;s side and started it running to the
right so that he could turn and get behind the
buffalo. Bent Arrow hesitated. If he rode after
Sly Fox, the warriors might think that he, too,
was disobeying orders. He remembered his
dream of the night before. The next moment
he sent Rock racing after the other horse. He
had to stop Sly Fox before it was too late. Rock
tried his best, but it wasn&rsquo;t good enough. Sly
Fox&rsquo;s horse had carried its rider alongside the
buffalo while Rock and Bent Arrow were still
several paces behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Sly Fox had his bow ready. He leaned toward
the buffalo, taking careful aim. As Sly
Fox drew the bow back, the buffalo swung its
head wildly. Sly Fox&rsquo;s startled horse dodged
aside, missed his footing, stumbled, and fell.
Sly Fox jumped clear of the falling horse, his
bow flying out of his hands as he lit. He leaned
over to grab the bow. Bent Arrow shouted a
warning. The buffalo had hesitated a moment
as though it were completely confused. Now it
charged at Sly Fox. Sly Fox glanced toward his
horse, but the buffalo was between them. The
boy turned and ran.</p>
<p>When the buffalo hesitated, it gave Rock a
chance to close the gap between them. As the
buffalo turned to charge at Sly Fox, Rock
whirled to follow. Bent Arrow&rsquo;s heart stood
still as he felt the horse&rsquo;s hoofs slip on the wet
grass. Somehow Rock kept from falling. In
two strides the horse was alongside the crazed
buffalo. One more jump and the buffalo would
be upon Sly Fox. Bent Arrow leaned toward
the buffalo, took quick aim, and fired the arrow
for the point just back of the buffalo&rsquo;s
foreleg. It was a good shot. The arrow sank in
to the shaft, but it seemed to have no effect on
the buffalo. The animal leaped forward. Its
head struck Sly Fox and sent him flying. The
buffalo half turned to charge again and then
suddenly slumped to the ground and lay still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/i06.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="414" />
<p class="caption">{<i>Bent Arrow leaned toward the buffalo and fired the arrow</i>}</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Before Bent Arrow could reach him, Sly
Fox jumped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saved my life, Bent Arrow!&rdquo; Sly Fox
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; Bent Arrow demanded
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem to be,&rdquo; Sly Fox answered.</p>
<p>Two warriors came dashing up to the boys.
Bent Arrow&rsquo;s heart sank when he saw that one
of the warriors was Chief Barking Wolf. The
chief looked sternly at Bent Arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave orders that no boy was to hunt buffaloes
today,&rdquo; he said sternly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Bent Arrow hung his head. For a moment
he had hoped that he would make his uncle
happy by acting bravely; instead, he had
brought disgrace because he had disobeyed
orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my fault,&rdquo; Sly Fox explained
quickly. &ldquo;I hunted the buffalo. Bent Arrow
killed it to save my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; Chief Barking Wolf ordered
gruffly.</p>
<p>Sly Fox told of how he had chased the buffalo
and how his horse had fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Bent Arrow and his horse hadn&rsquo;t acted
quickly, the buffalo would have killed me,&rdquo;
Sly Fox finished.</p>
<p>Chief Barking Wolf turned toward Bent
Arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did well,&rdquo; he praised, a smile replacing
the stern look on his face. &ldquo;I like an almost-warrior
who doesn&rsquo;t make excuses. A good
Crow knows when orders must be disobeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow felt a lump rising in his throat
as it had done when his uncle praised his running.
He bent his head so the chief couldn&rsquo;t
see his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Chief Barking Wolf jumped from his horse.
He and the warrior stepped over to the slain
buffalo. Together they rolled the animal over
on its other side. The shaft of the arrow had
been broken off as the animal fell on it. Barking
Wolf studied the broken arrow for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a very good shot,&rdquo; he said, turning
toward Bent Arrow, &ldquo;well aimed, and
powerfully driven. But you have lost your
good arrow. It is broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is to have mine,&rdquo; Sly Fox said, offering
it to Bent Arrow.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow hesitated. The arrow had been
given to Sly Fox to keep as a token that he had
been on a buffalo hunt. Sly Fox would want
it to show to younger boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; Chief Barking Wolf commanded.
&ldquo;If Sly Fox had not offered it to you,
I would have ordered him to break it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chief Barking Wolf mounted his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to go back to camp alone,&rdquo; he told
Sly Fox. &ldquo;You have disobeyed orders. You are
not in this hunting party.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Without a word, Sly Fox mounted his horse
and started back to camp. Bent Arrow felt
sorry for his friend, yet he knew that Sly Fox
was lucky. Chief Barking Wolf might have
ordered a far more severe punishment for the
boy&rsquo;s disobedience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the pack horses,&rdquo; the chief ordered.
&ldquo;The men are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As many buffaloes as could possibly be
taken back to camp had been slain. The hunters
had turned back and were butchering the
animals. As the boys came to a hunter, they
would stop the herd of pack horses and leave
those belonging to that warrior. When they
came to Flying Arrow, Bent Arrow drove his
two horses from the herd and dismounted to
help his uncle.</p>
<p>Butchering was done swiftly. The hide was
removed and the carcass dressed. The meat
was cut into large pieces and then wrapped in
the hides to make two bundles. The bundles
were laid across the pack horses&rsquo; backs in such
a way that they balanced each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The greatest difficulty was in preparing the
head. First the tongue was removed. Every
Crow knew that the tongue was one of the best
parts of the buffalo. Next the head was cut
from the carcass and beaten against a rock until
the bone shattered. Then the brain was
removed. Crow squaws would need the brain
to rub on the underside of the hide. Without
it, the hide could not be properly tanned.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow and his uncle were the first to
have their buffaloes butchered and the meat
loaded on pack horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the hide from the buffalo you
killed,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said. &ldquo;Since killing that
buffalo saved the life of a Crow, the hide
should be good medicine for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow nodded. Every Crow carried a
small pouch in which he had his medicine.
The medicine wasn&rsquo;t carried as something to
cure sickness; it was to help guard the warrior
from danger. Not all warriors had the same
things in their medicine bags. Usually a warrior
learned in a dream what he should put in
his medicine bag to protect him. In Flying
Arrow&rsquo;s medicine bag there were the claw of a
bear, a piece of the fur of a wolf, and a hawk&rsquo;s
feather. In a dream a bear had told Flying
Arrow to get a hawk&rsquo;s feather to carry with a
bear&rsquo;s claw and a piece of wolf fur. It must
have been powerful medicine. Since he had
had it, Flying Arrow had made many successful
raids. Bent Arrow hoped his would prove
as powerful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>When Flying Arrow saw the buffalo that
Bent Arrow had killed, he seemed pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides the skin, we shall take the buffalo&rsquo;s
heart,&rdquo; he told Bent Arrow. &ldquo;It was a brave
buffalo. By eating its heart, you will become
braver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a triumphant band of hunters that
rode back into camp as the sun was sinking in
the western sky. Here was a great supply of
meat to be added to the tribe&rsquo;s winter store.
In a few days the hunting party could start
back toward the big winter camp of all the
Crow tribes.</p>
<p>As soon as the pack horses were unloaded
and put back into the corral, Flying Arrow
cooked fresh buffalo steaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take a gift to Clawing Bear,&rdquo; he
told Bent Arrow. &ldquo;The medicine man will
want to know about your hunting. It may be
that he will have found another message in the
dream you had last night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Flying Arrow selected the choicest tongue,
wrapped it carefully, and handed it to Bent
Arrow. As he made his way toward the medicine
man&rsquo;s tepee with the gift in his hands,
Bent Arrow had the feeling that this was to be
a very happy visit for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c3"><br /><i>CHAPTER THREE</i></h2>
<p>While Bent Arrow was still several
paces from the medicine man&rsquo;s tepee,
Clawing Bear called out to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Bent Arrow, and tell me about
the buffalo you killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know that I had killed a buffalo?&rdquo;
Bent Arrow asked. &ldquo;Did someone report
to you so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Clawing Bear answered with a smile.
&ldquo;Sometimes we medicine men see things
which others cannot see. Now tell me about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>As briefly as he could, Bent Arrow told of
Sly Fox&rsquo;s attempt to shoot a buffalo and how
his horse had stumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My horse deserves more credit than I,&rdquo;
Bent Arrow finished. &ldquo;By the time I would
have thought of what to do, it would have
been too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I saw it,&rdquo; Clawing Bear
said, nodding. &ldquo;Yet you have not received too
much credit. You did well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The medicine man filled his pipe and lit it
with an ember from the fire. He blew smoke
to the north, the east, the south, and the
west. He laid the pipe aside and stared into
the fire as though he were watching some
interesting happening. When he spoke, his
voice was so low that Bent Arrow had to lean
forward to catch his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were in great danger today,&rdquo; Clawing
Bear told him. &ldquo;You did not have the proper
medicine. When I saw you chasing that buffalo,
there was a buzzard soaring above you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Bent Arrow shivered. Buzzards were the
omen of misfortune. They picked the flesh
from slain animals and from warriors who had
not been given proper burial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could see that the buzzard was watching
you,&rdquo; Clawing Bear continued. &ldquo;When you
leaned toward the buffalo to shoot your arrow,
the buzzard started down. Then I caught sight
of an eagle above the buzzard. A feather fell
from the eagle&rsquo;s tail. It passed just ahead of
the buzzard&rsquo;s beak. The buzzard turned and
flew away. You must have an eagle&rsquo;s feather.
It is your good medicine to protect you from
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I to get an eagle&rsquo;s feather?&rdquo; Bent
Arrow asked. &ldquo;The eagles nest far up on the
peaks. Already the snow is deep there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have an eagle feather,&rdquo; Clawing
Bear insisted.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow asked no more questions. If
Clawing Bear knew the way for him to get an
eagle feather, the medicine man would have
told him. Before Clawing Bear dismissed Bent
Arrow, he examined the boy&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;My medicine has done all it can,&rdquo; Clawing
Bear said. &ldquo;You must do much walking and
running. I believe that when you have found
an eagle feather, you will be cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day was a busy one for the boys
who had been with the hunters. It was their
job to build tripods on which the squaws
would hang the buffalo meat to dry and smoke.
Sly Fox was not allowed to help. As an added
punishment for hunting when he was ordered
not to, he was given the task of dragging the
heavy buffalo hides to the river where the
squaws would tan them.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow worked eagerly. It was good to
see the supply of meat being prepared for
winter use. Best of all, meat hanging on the
tripods meant that tomorrow would come the
call for a game of wolves.</p>
<p>Twice during the day, Bent Arrow saw the
swimming teacher, but the warrior didn&rsquo;t
speak to him. If he had plans for a game of
wolves, the teacher was keeping them to himself.
The next morning, at the swimming
lesson, Bent Arrow stayed near the teacher,
hoping there would be word of the game, but
again nothing was said. However, when Bent
Arrow had returned to the tepee and was
eating his meal, a low whistle sounded. That
was the signal for the boys to meet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Bent Arrow hurried out of the tepee, but
as soon as he was outside he moved cautiously.
He slipped from his tepee to the next one and
on down the line to the last. Here he dropped
to his hands and knees and crawled until he
had crossed the low hill and was out of sight
of the camp.</p>
<p>By the time Bent Arrow reached the meeting
place, the teacher and several boys were
there. Bent Arrow took his place in the circle
of boys. All of them waited for the late-comers.</p>
<p>As soon as the last boy arrived, the teacher
began to explain the game of wolves. Although
Bent Arrow had heard the explanation before,
he listened as intently as the two younger boys
who were hearing it for the first time. The
teacher gave a brief account of the wolves who
were the Crow scouts. He told of the time the
wolves had disguised themselves and crawled
across the prairie and made a successful attack
on a large hunting party of Sioux.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Today you are the wolves,&rdquo; he told the
boys. &ldquo;The meat on the tripods represents
Sioux horses. The boy who captures the first
Sioux horse and the boy who captures the
largest one will get these prizes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow gave a gasp of elation when the
teacher held up two eagle feathers. Here was
a simple way to get the medicine which Clawing
Bear had said he must have. He was so
sure he would win one of the prizes that he
almost reached out for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now disguise yourselves as wolves,&rdquo; the
teacher ordered.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow and the other boys trooped to
the riverbank. They dug up handfuls of mud
and completely covered themselves with it,
even rubbing the mud into their hair. As the
mud dried, it took on a grayish tinge so that
when the boys crawled through the dry grass
their coloring blended with it and they could
hardly be seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>At a signal from the teacher, the boys separated
and started toward camp. Bent Arrow
circled around the camp to approach the tripods
of meat from the far side. If the squaws
were expecting a raid, they wouldn&rsquo;t look for
the raiders to come from that direction. When
he neared the camp, he got to his hands and
knees and crawled.</p>
<p>The row of tripods extended beyond the
last tepee in camp. Bent Arrow saw two
squaws standing in front of that tepee talking
together. He heard one of the squaws say that
they should be watching for a magpie raid.
The squaws always referred to the boys in the
wolf game as magpies, because flocks of magpies
often swarmed on the drying meat.</p>
<p>One of the women glanced straight at Bent
Arrow. He held himself motionless. It didn&rsquo;t
seem possible that she would fail to see him,
but she turned toward her own tepee. Bent
Arrow breathed a sigh of relief when the other
squaw went on with her work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Bent Arrow crawled to the first tripod.
None of the pieces of meat on it was very large.
He looked down the line to the next tripod.
There was a large piece hanging on it. Before
he crawled ahead, Bent Arrow glanced toward
the tepees again. None of the squaws was
watching. When he reached the second tripod,
he found that the piece of meat wasn&rsquo;t as
large as he had thought. He glanced down the
line. There was a much larger chunk on a tripod
farther along. Again he made sure that
no squaw was watching before he crawled on.</p>
<p>This time he had made no mistake. He had
found a large piece of meat, so large, in fact,
that it was sure to win the prize. He reached
out to take it from the tripod. At that instant
there was a loud chatter of talk behind him.
He jumped to his feet to run, but he was too
late. A squaw grabbed him with a grip too
powerful for him to twist loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out who this thief is,&rdquo; the squaw
stormed.</p>
<p>In spite of Bent Arrow&rsquo;s twisting and struggling,
he was dragged to the near-by spring.
The squaw held him with one hand. With
the other she dipped water and splashed it on
his face until all of the mud was washed off.
By the time that she had finished, she was
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that the magpie is Bent Arrow,&rdquo; she
said with a smile. &ldquo;Well, grab a chunk of meat
and run. Boys will be boys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Bent Arrow seized the meat and dashed
out of the camp. He was the last boy to get
back to the meeting place. A fire had been
built, and meat already was roasting over it.
The teacher took Bent Arrow&rsquo;s meat and put
it over the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You captured a truly large piece of meat,&rdquo;
he told Bent Arrow.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow made no reply. He took his
place in the circle of boys. He was able to give
only part of his attention to the words the
teacher was speaking. He had brought the
largest chunk of meat. That entitled him to
the eagle feather. Still, there was an uneasy
doubt in his mind. He thought back to the
teacher&rsquo;s instructions. They had been that a
prize went to the one who captured the largest
one. Captured&mdash;His thoughts were interrupted
by the call to food.</p>
<p>The meat was good, and the adventure of
having helped get it in a raid added to its
flavor. Ordinarily Bent Arrow would have
enjoyed it greatly. Now he was so busy with his
thoughts that he scarcely noticed its taste.
When everyone had eaten his fill, the teacher
called for the boys&rsquo; attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have an account of your adventures,&rdquo;
he announced. &ldquo;Running Elk, you were the
first to return with a prize. Tell us how you
did so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Running Elk stood up. He told that he had
thought of the shortest way to camp. He had
taken the risk of running to the first tepee and
walking from it to the nearest tripod. It had
occurred to him that the squaws would pay
no attention to one boy. He had been right.
He had grabbed a piece of meat and was away
from the camp while the other boys were still
crawling toward the tripods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did well,&rdquo; the teacher praised. &ldquo;Sometimes
it is better to take greater risks in order
to catch the enemy unprepared. This eagle
feather is the reward for your coup. You may
wear it as a warrior would who had counted
coup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Running Elk responded,
proudly accepting the award.</p>
<p>Several other boys who had returned
quickly with their captures were called upon.
After them the teacher turned to Bent Arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;You brought the largest piece of meat,
Bent Arrow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell us of your adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow hesitated. Slowly he shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t capture it,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;A squaw
captured me. She let me take the piece of
meat so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to return empty-handed.
I didn&rsquo;t win the prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wave of laughter ran around the circle
of boys as Bent Arrow hung his head. A stern
look from the teacher stopped the laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the meat was a gift, you did not earn
the prize,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;However, you have
shown yourself to be a good Crow by refusing
to take an unearned reward. If I had another
prize, you should have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher turned to Sly Fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours was next in size,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell of
your adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sly Fox admitted that he had been lucky.
He had selected the largest piece of meat on
the first tripod that he came to. He had wanted
to look farther for a larger piece, but as several
squaws were moving about the tepees, he had
decided to take that piece and get away. He
was glad that he had won the prize.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did well,&rdquo; the teacher said. &ldquo;This
eagle feather is yours to be worn as proudly
as a warrior who has counted coup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Sly Fox responded as he accepted
the prize.</p>
<p>He turned to face Bent Arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to give this coup feather to you,
Bent Arrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not only because you
have proved yourself a good Crow, but also
because you saved my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow gave a gasp of pleasure. He was
to have the eagle feather which Clawing Bear
said he needed for his medicine bag. He
reached out his hand to accept it but, at the
last moment, drew his hand back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t accept it,&rdquo; he pointed out. &ldquo;People
would see it and think that I had won the
prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher nodded his approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll rest a while,&rdquo; the teacher announced.
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll swim to wash off the mud. That
will be the end of our game.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Bent Arrow was the first to dive into the
water, and Sly Fox was not far behind him.
The two boys scuffled for a time, each trying
to duck the other. Bent Arrow managed to
get a lucky hold and was able to shove Sly
Fox&rsquo;s head under the water. When Bent Arrow
released him, Sly Fox came sputtering to the
surface. He laughingly swam a few strokes
away from Bent Arrow, but a moment later
he swam close again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are Sioux warriors on the other
bank,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;One of them moved
just as I got my head out of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow just managed to keep from
glancing toward the other bank. A look in
that direction might have warned the hidden
Sioux that they had been seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s swim to the teacher and tell him so
that he can call the boys from the water,&rdquo; Sly
Fox suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better pretend that we are still playing,&rdquo;
Bent Arrow warned. &ldquo;The Sioux will
suspect any strange actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sly Fox nodded and made a sudden dash at
Bent Arrow. Bent Arrow swam away as rapidly
as he could. Anyone watching would have
thought that it was an accident that Bent
Arrow swam so close to the teacher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sly Fox saw Sioux warriors on the other
bank,&rdquo; Bent Arrow whispered, as he swam
near the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep up your game,&rdquo; the teacher ordered
without glancing toward him.</p>
<p>Obediently Bent Arrow turned and swam
back out into the stream. Sly Fox guessed his
purpose and swam in pursuit. A few minutes
later the teacher whistled the signal for the
boys to come out of the water. Bent Arrow
and Sly Fox were the last to climb up onto
the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as you are behind the willows, start
running to camp,&rdquo; the teacher ordered in a
whisper. &ldquo;The rest of us will follow later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow and Sly Fox walked slowly to
the clump of willows. As soon as the brush hid
them from watchers on the other bank, the
two boys broke into a run. Bent Arrow ran
straight to his uncle&rsquo;s tepee, while Sly Fox
ran on to take the warning to Chief Barking
Wolf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>This time no warriors were sent on foot.
All of them went to the corral for horses.
The warriors were divided into two parties,
one under Flying Arrow went upstream, while
the other under Chief Barking Wolf went
downstream. As the warriors rode out of camp,
the teacher returned with the other boys.</p>
<p>The sun was still high in the western sky
when the warriors returned empty-handed.
Bent Arrow took his uncle&rsquo;s horse to the
corral and hurried back to the tepee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got away again,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said.
&ldquo;We ought to send a party of warriors to
punish them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening the warriors were summoned
to a council meeting. Bent Arrow was proud
that he was summoned too. When he and his
uncle reached the council wigwam, Sly Fox
was there. The two boys waited until all of
the warriors had entered before they went into
the tepee. They sat well back from the circle
of warriors. Chief Barking Wolf stood up to
speak first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are far from other Crow camps,&rdquo; the
chief said. &ldquo;We have much meat that we
want to get to the winter camp. Since Sioux
warriors have twice been seen watching us,
it would seem wise for us to break camp
quickly and get to our winter grounds where
we shall have the help of many Crows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Chief Barking Wolf sat down. He picked up
the ceremonial pipe. Leaning forward, he
picked an ember from the fire and lighted the
pipe. He took three puffs before he passed
the pipe to Flying Arrow sitting on his right.
Flying Arrow took three puffs and passed the
pipe on to the next warrior. Slowly the pipe
went around the circle of warriors and returned
to the chief. He laid it aside carefully.
Flying Arrow got to his feet to speak next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barking Wolf has spoken wisely,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow agreed. &ldquo;We are far from other Crow
warriors. Yet it is bad to allow the Sioux to
spy on our camp, to make plans to steal our
horses and take our scalps. They should be
punished. I believe we should send a party
of warriors to teach those Sioux a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow expected to hear shouts of approval
come from the circle of warriors. Instead,
the warriors sat silently looking into
the fire. Again Chief Barking Wolf lit the
pipe and started it around the circle. When it
came back to him, he carefully put it in its
wrappings. This was a sign that any warrior
who wished to speak would now be heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Some of the warriors did speak. A few
thought that the Sioux should be punished,
but all of them agreed with Chief Barking
Wolf that there should be a larger party of
Crows before the attempt was made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall go alone,&rdquo; Flying Arrow told
the warriors. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take some of their horses.
The Sioux must be punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the warriors tried to convince Flying
Arrow that he should wait until a large
war party could be sent against the Sioux. To
all urgings, Flying Arrow shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon Old-Man-of-the-North will send
snow,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to wait
until spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be better if we could spare a warrior
to go with you,&rdquo; Chief Barking Wolf said
thoughtfully, &ldquo;but it will take all of our men
to get the meat to winter camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c4"><br /><i>CHAPTER FOUR</i></h2>
<p>As soon as he and Bent Arrow had returned
to their tepee, Flying Arrow began to
make preparations for his raid against the
Sioux. While Bent Arrow helped his uncle,
his mind was busy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief Barking Wolf thinks that you should
not go alone,&rdquo; Bent Arrow suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be much better if two of us could
go together,&rdquo; Flying Arrow agreed. &ldquo;However,
Barking Wolf is right in saying that he can&rsquo;t
spare another warrior from the hunting
party.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;I could go with you,&rdquo; Bent Arrow pointed
out.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow looked at him with surprise.
For a moment Bent Arrow thought that his
suggestion was going to rouse his uncle&rsquo;s
anger. Then the warrior smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have known that you don&rsquo;t make
words just to hear the sound of them,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I am proud that you offered to go, but this
raid is too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would get the exercise which Clawing
Bear says I need,&rdquo; Bent Arrow urged. &ldquo;I might
find an eagle feather, and I can help you by
tending the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow made no answer. Instead, he
gave all of his attention to arranging the
things he was to take with him. Bent Arrow
began to fear that he had talked too much.
Evidently he had made his uncle angry. Flying
Arrow emptied the arrows from his quiver.
Two of them he tossed into the fire. He
selected three of the best and handed them to
Bent Arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may need these,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There will
be hunting to do and perhaps even a fight with
the Sioux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am to go with you?&rdquo; Bent Arrow
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Flying Arrow answered, nodding.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need help, and you need the training. I
know you&rsquo;ll obey orders. When I tell you to
stay back from danger, you will do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When everything else was prepared, Flying
Arrow filled two small bags with dried buffalo
meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be times when we don&rsquo;t dare
build a fire,&rdquo; he explained, handing one of
the bags to Bent Arrow.</p>
<p>The next morning, just as the eastern sky
was lighting up, Flying Arrow led the way
out of camp. He was mounted on his best
horse. When he had given Bent Arrow his
choice of the horses, Bent Arrow had selected
Rock.</p>
<p>Although the ground was white with frost,
when they came to the river, Bent Arrow
jumped from his horse and swam across. On
the other side of the river, he trotted beside
his horse until he was thoroughly warmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/i07.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="698" />
<p class="caption"><i>Flying Arrow led the way out of camp</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Instead of continuing north to find the
Sioux trail, Flying Arrow turned east and
selected the easiest route along the riverbank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the Sioux circled north and later
returned to the river,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
find their trail before the day is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several times during the day, Bent Arrow
dismounted and trotted along beside his horse.
Clawing Bear had said he needed exercise.
Bent Arrow was determined to leave nothing
undone that would help cure his leg.</p>
<p>The sun was still hanging in the western
sky when Flying Arrow stopped. Bent Arrow
was worried because they had not found the
Sioux trail. Flying Arrow seemed to read his
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux traveled farther before returning
to the river than I expected them to,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll camp here. We&rsquo;ll find their
trail soon when we start on tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Bent Arrow tended the horses while Flying
Arrow built a fire and cooked the meat they
had brought with them. When Bent Arrow
returned to the camping spot, he could see
his uncle before he could see the tiny campfire.
Flying Arrow was taking no chances of a fire
or its smoke attracting the Sioux.</p>
<p>It was scarcely daylight the next morning
when the two Crows started. Flying Arrow
watched the ground closely as he rode along.
They had not gone far when he dismounted.
When Bent Arrow dismounted to join his
uncle, he saw the hoofmarks of several horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux went to the river to water their
horses,&rdquo; Flying Arrow explained, pointing to
the tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they cross the river?&rdquo; Bent Arrow
asked anxiously, thinking that the Sioux might
have circled back and attacked the Crow hunting
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; Flying Arrow answered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll find their trail a little farther
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow started ahead, leading his
horse. Bent Arrow followed him. They had
gone only a short distance when they came
upon the Sioux trail leading from the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is as I expected,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said.
&ldquo;The Sioux camped by the river. It looks as
though they have given up their plan to raid
our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they on their way to the Sioux winter
camp?&rdquo; Bent Arrow asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they are going farther toward the
land of the rising sun,&rdquo; Flying Arrow answered.
&ldquo;Probably they want to hunt before
they go to winter camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He studied the trail carefully. Bent Arrow,
too, looked at the many tracks. He tried to
judge how many warriors were in the hunting
party. From the tracks, he decided there had
been about as many Sioux as he and Flying
Arrow together had fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were about this many warriors,&rdquo;
Flying Arrow said, holding up both hands
with his fingers spread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there were more,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the hoofprints were made by
horses without riders,&rdquo; Flying Arrow explained.
&ldquo;See, there is a difference in the
prints.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>

<p class="caption"><i>He tried to gauge how many warriors were in the party</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Bent Arrow looked where his uncle pointed.
Some of the hoofmarks were deeper and
clearer than others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that the deeper prints were made
by horses that came at the end of the herd,&rdquo;
Bent Arrow told his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good trailing,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
praised. &ldquo;Even some warriors wouldn&rsquo;t have
noticed that there was a difference in the
tracks. However, the deeper marks are made
by horses carrying riders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we catch up with the Sioux today?&rdquo;
Bent Arrow asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless they stop to hunt,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow answered. &ldquo;They are too far ahead of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Flying Arrow remounted, he did not
follow the Sioux trail. Instead, he stayed on
the level ground a short distance from the
riverbank. He kept his horse going faster than
he had the day before. Several times Bent
Arrow dismounted and ran beside his horse.
He found that he was able to run farther
before his leg began to hurt. The sun had
sunk to the top of the western hills when the
two Crows again crossed the Sioux trail. Flying
Arrow dismounted to study it briefly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are getting close to them,&rdquo; he gloated.
&ldquo;In a day or two we may be able to make a
raid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They traveled until dark. Again Bent Arrow
cared for the horses while his uncle made
camp. This time, when Bent Arrow returned
to camp, there was no fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll eat some of the dried meat we
brought,&rdquo; Flying Arrow told him. &ldquo;The Sioux
have sharp noses. Even the smallest fire might
give off enough smoke to warn them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow glanced around quickly as
though expecting to find a Sioux watching
from the brush near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t that close,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
said with a smile. &ldquo;Probably they are half a
sun&rsquo;s ride ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Bent Arrow knew that the Sioux would have
little chance to surprise them. Flying Eagle
heard every noise, no matter how slight, and
he always knew the meaning of the noise.
Nevertheless, he had a feeling of uneasiness
as he crawled into his blankets to sleep. The
moment that he fell asleep, he dreamed that
he saw an eagle soaring overhead. In his dream
he followed the eagle, hoping it would drop
a feather. He followed the eagle over hills and
across a small stream. At last a feather fell from
the eagle and floated down. As Bent Arrow
was running to get the feather, some sound
awakened him.</p>
<p>Although it was still dark, Bent Arrow could
see his uncle moving about. Silently Bent
Arrow crawled out of his blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to scout ahead on foot,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow explained. &ldquo;It may be that I can reach
the Sioux camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go with you,&rdquo; Bent Arrow urged.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as it is light, you water the horses,&rdquo;
he ordered. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not back by then, you
might hunt near the river for game. We&rsquo;ll
need food.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>After Flying Arrow slipped away into the
darkness, Bent Arrow sat on his robe and
waited until the eastern sky gave enough light
so he could see. He took the horses to the river
and let them drink. He found a hidden place
where there was plenty of grass for the horses.
He returned to the camping place, rolled up
the blankets, and hid them. He took a small
branch from a tree. With this he brushed the
ground until there were no signs of the camp
left.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow arranged two sticks to tell his
uncle where the horses were in case the warrior
was the first to get back to the camping place.
He went back on the trail he and his uncle had
followed the day before. When he thought
that he was far enough from the camping
place, he went toward the river. He hunted
along the river until he found the place he
wanted. It was a clump of willows near the
river and along a well-worn trail leading to it.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow had been hidden in the clump
of willows only a short time when he caught
the faint sound of something coming down
the trail. He kneeled, waiting tensely as the
sound came nearer. His heart was pounding
wildly when a fine buck stepped into view.
The deer stopped, lifted its head, and sniffed
suspiciously. Evidently it failed to catch Bent
Arrow&rsquo;s scent, because it came on toward the
river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Bent Arrow waited until the buck was a step
past him before he fired. The arrow struck the
deer just back of the foreleg. The animal
crumpled beside the path. There was a scurrying
farther back. Bent Arrow knew that the
sound was made by other deer which had been
following the buck. Their sharp ears had
caught the sound, warning them of danger.
They were fleeing back up the trail.</p>
<p>Although he wanted to jump up and run
over to look at the first deer he had ever shot,
Bent Arrow remained hidden in the clump
of willows. It was possible that a Sioux warrior
would be hunting along the river. As
Bent Arrow waited patiently, he felt more and
more uneasy. There was an unnatural stillness
around him. It wasn&rsquo;t only that there was no
movement along the path, but there was nothing
stirring on either side of the river.</p>
<p>As he waited, still crouched on one knee,
the awkward position began to make his leg
hurt. The pain increased rapidly. It hurt
below his knee, where the old injury was, and
all the way up his leg. Little beads of sweat
moistened his brow. He had to move. As he
tensed himself to shift his position without
touching a twig or making any other sign of
movement, he saw a branch move on the other
side of the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Bent Arrow almost forgot his pain as his
eyes searched the other bank. Another branch
moved slightly. A Sioux warrior crawled out
to the river bank and leaned down to drink. In
his excitement, Bent Arrow had forgotten the
pain in his leg. Now it swept over him, and
he remembered that it was Sioux warriors
who had injured him and made him different
from other Crow boys. He took careful aim
at the unsuspecting warrior across the stream.</p>
<p>Before he let the arrow fly, Bent Arrow
knew it would be a mistake to shoot. If he
missed, or if he injured the warrior, or even
if his shot was successful, the Sioux would be
warned. There would be no chance of Flying
Arrow&rsquo;s plan succeeding. Silently Bent Arrow
lowered his bow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>When the Sioux warrior had drunk his fill,
he raised his head and listened. Slowly he got
to his feet, and his sharp glance swept up and
down the river. Bent Arrow was thankful that
the deer had fallen to one side of the path
where it was hidden from the Sioux&rsquo;s sight. At
last the Sioux slipped back from the river. For
a few paces Bent Arrow could follow the warrior&rsquo;s
progress by the slight movement of the
underbrush. Soon he could no longer see any
sign of movement. He had no way of knowing
whether the Sioux had stopped or whether
he was moving more carefully. There was
nothing to do except wait.</p>
<p>The sun had risen and, to Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
anxious eyes, seemed to be racing up the sky.
By this time Flying Arrow would have returned
to camp. He would wait for a time,
but when Bent Arrow failed to return, Flying
Arrow would come to look for him.</p>
<p>Finally Bent Arrow decided that he must
take the risk. He crept out of his hiding place
and slipped away from the river, keeping near
the trail. When he was far enough back from
the stream so that no watcher on the other side
could see him, he crossed the trail and started
back toward the river. He moved carefully.
Before he took a step, he glanced ahead to
make sure he could avoid touching any
branches. When he came near the deer, he
dropped to his hands and knees. He crawled
the remaining distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>The deer had fallen in such a way that a
clump of brush hid it from the other side of
the river. However, it was so close to the brush
that it seemed impossible for Bent Arrow to
move it without stirring the branches. Carefully
he inched the deer away from the brush.
He got it away from the brush without causing
the branches to move noticeably. It was a long,
tedious task, dragging the deer and avoiding
the brush and shrubs, but at last Bent Arrow
got it to a place well enough hidden that he
could lift it to his shoulders.</p>
<p>Instead of going straight toward the camping
place, Bent Arrow went due north. When
he was at a point directly west of the camp, he
hung the deer on a low tree branch. Then he
went toward camp.</p>
<p>He had covered about half the distance to
the camp, when he caught a slight movement
directly ahead of him. He stopped and slowly
brought his bow into position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Bent Arrow,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
called softly, stepping into view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Bent Arrow quickly ran to his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a deer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I saw a Sioux
warrior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get our horses and move farther
away before we talk more,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
decided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c5"><br /><i>CHAPTER FIVE</i></h2>
<p>When they had their horses, the two
Crows rode back to the tree where Bent
Arrow had left the deer. Flying Arrow took the
deer on his horse. He led the way back over
the trail they had followed the day before.
The sun was starting down the western sky
when Flying Arrow turned north off the trail.
After a time he stopped in a small valley.
There was a small stream running through
the valley. There were trees to furnish concealment
and fuel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the horses had been tended,
the deer properly butchered, and steaks frying
over the fire that Flying Arrow had Bent
Arrow tell his story. At the end of the story,
Flying Arrow nodded his head in approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did well,&rdquo; he praised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going to raid the Sioux camp
tonight?&rdquo; Bent Arrow asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; Flying Arrow assured him. &ldquo;I
was close to their camp before daylight. Their
scouts had found a herd of buffalo across the
river. They are hunting today. Tonight they
will gorge themselves on buffalo meat. They
will sleep so soundly that we will be able to
take our pick of their horses. Their chief has
two fine ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would that warrior have been at the
river alone?&rdquo; Bent Arrow wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably he had been sent out to watch
the herd,&rdquo; Flying Arrow explained. &ldquo;He was
coming back to join the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is the reason,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is your leg better?&rdquo; Flying Arrow asked.
&ldquo;You carried the deer a long way, and I noticed
that you weren&rsquo;t limping when you came to
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better, although it hurt when I was
kneeling in that clump of willows,&rdquo; Bent
Arrow told him. &ldquo;I hope I can find an ea&mdash;.
Look, Uncle. Look. There&rsquo;s an eagle soaring
above us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow&rsquo;s glance followed Bent
Arrow&rsquo;s pointing finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s an eagle,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must follow it,&rdquo; Bent Arrow exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that it will drop the feather I need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told Flying Eagle of his dream. Flying
Eagle listened and, at the end, thoughtfully
considered what Bent Arrow had told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since your dream wasn&rsquo;t finished, it is difficult
to tell what it means,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
said. &ldquo;Still, Clawing Bear said that you must
have an eagle feather. It would almost seem
that the eagle has been sent here to bring you
a feather. Go carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow picked up his bow and arrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down the river to the forks,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow said. &ldquo;When you return, meet me there.
We&rsquo;ll cross the river after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back before you&rsquo;re ready to leave,&rdquo;
Bent Arrow answered confidently. &ldquo;The eagle
isn&rsquo;t far from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s farther than you think,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
told him. &ldquo;It is so high in the sky that the
distance deceives you. We&rsquo;ll plan to meet at
the forks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow had not gone far before he
realized that his uncle had been right about
how far away the eagle was. The bird seemed
to be motionless in the sky, yet Bent Arrow
could not see that the distance had lessened.
Fortunately he did not have to move carefully.
If the Sioux were hunting on the other side
of the river, there was no immediate danger
from them. Bent Arrow had started at a fast
run. Now be slowed his pace so that he would
not tire so quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>As he neared the river, where the trees were
close together, Bent Arrow sometimes lost sight
of the eagle. The bird seemed still to be hovering
in one spot, but that spot was ahead. When
he came to the river, Bent Arrow stopped.
He was sure that his uncle hadn&rsquo;t intended for
him to cross the stream. He looked up at the
eagle again. It was much closer. Bent Arrow
glanced back the way he had come as though
considering going back to ask permission
before he crossed the river. But the afternoon
was far spent. It would take too much time
for him to make the trip to camp and return.
If he was to get the eagle feather, he must
go now.</p>
<p>He slipped quietly into the river and swam
across. On the other shore he hid himself in
a clump of brush. He listened carefully. The
only sounds he heard were made by the movements
of wild creatures who lived among the
trees. That was good. He glanced up into the
sky. The eagle was almost straight above his
head.</p>
<p>Although he was eager to get directly under
the eagle and wait for it to drop a feather,
Bent Arrow didn&rsquo;t forget caution. He walked
carefully avoiding low-hanging branches and
dry twigs which might snap if he stepped on
them.</p>
<p>As he moved ahead, Bent Arrow continually
looked up at the eagle. It wasn&rsquo;t long until he
was directly under the bird. He found a good
hiding place and settled himself to wait for a
feather to drop. It was tiring, waiting and looking
up into the sky. Then, to Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
dismay, the eagle soared south.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<div class="img" id="pic5">
<img src="images/i09.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="783" />
<p class="caption"><i>Bent Arrow continually looked up at the eagle</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Bent Arrow left his hiding place and followed.
He was soon far enough from the river
so that there were few trees. It would be difficult
to hide if danger appeared. Suddenly
the eagle changed from its easy soaring to
swift flight. Hopelessly Bent Arrow watched
it. There was no use to try to follow. Even
the swiftest horse couldn&rsquo;t keep up with that
fast-flying bird. A moment later, Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
heart gave a great bound. The eagle had
turned and was soaring back toward him.</p>
<p>Although the eagle stopped before it had
come all the way back, Bent Arrow&rsquo;s hopes
returned. He could go that much farther. He
hurried forward. He came to a hill on which
no trees were growing. He started up it swiftly.
It looked as though the eagle were almost
straight above the top of the hill. Near the
top, Bent Arrow remembered his training. He
dropped to his hands and knees and crawled.
At the top he stretched out to look ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>On the other side of the hill was a small
valley. There were a few trees growing in a
clump on the valley floor. Bent Arrow saw a
sparkle which he knew was sunshine reflected
from a bubbling spring. This valley would be
a fine place for the Sioux to make camp, but
there was no sign of them.</p>
<p>As he lay there, Bent Arrow&rsquo;s ear caught a
rumbling sound carried by the ground. It took
him a moment to realize what caused the
noise. It was the rumble made by a great herd
of running buffaloes, and he knew the Sioux
must be near.</p>
<p>Again Bent Arrow looked up into the sky.
His heart sank when there was no sign of the
eagle, but the next moment he saw it again.
The bird had soared a short distance toward
the river. Now it had turned and was coming
back. Bent Arrow gave a cry of triumph when
he saw a feather floating from the eagle and
dropping toward him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>He leaped to his feet. But while the feather
was still high in the air, a breeze caught it
and wafted it away from him toward the trees
in the valley. Bent Arrow raced toward it. It
looked as though the feather was going to
lodge in the trees, but another gust of air
lifted it over them. As Bent Arrow ran up the
hill at the far side of the valley, the feather
was just out of reach above his head. A few
more steps and he would be able to grab it.</p>
<p>Near the top of the hill, the feather was low
enough, but it was so far ahead that Bent
Arrow could not quite grasp it. He sprinted
forward. The feather barely cleared the top
of the hill. Bent Arrow tensed himself to dive
for it. Instead, he dropped to the ground. In
the valley below him were Sioux warriors
butchering the buffaloes that they had killed.</p>
<p>At the moment Bent Arrow saw the Sioux,
he also saw the feather lodge against a weed a
few steps ahead of him. He dared not crawl
down to it. At any moment a Sioux warrior
might glance up and see him. He had to crawl
back off that hilltop before he was discovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Bent Arrow pushed himself back. Each inch
that he moved back was torture. Every movement
had to be painstakingly careful or it
would attract attention. A Sioux warrior
looked up from his work and glanced directly
at Bent Arrow. Bent Arrow held himself motionless.
When the warrior went back to his
work, Bent Arrow resumed his backward
crawling. When he was finally across the hill,
he continued to crawl until he could stand
without being seen from the other side. He
wanted to run for the shelter of the trees.
Instead he walked. A Sioux warrior might
catch the thud of running feet.</p>
<p>It was all Bent Arrow could do to keep
from running. Step by slow step, he went
down the hill and came to the trees. In his
mind he had been thinking of the trees as a
hiding place. When he reached them, he knew
he must go on. Undoubtedly the Sioux would
select this spot for their camp. He crossed the
valley and climbed the hill at that side, constantly
looking back. At the top of the hill, he
took one last backward glance. The head of a
Sioux horse was just coming into sight at the
top of the hill on the other side of the valley.
Bent Arrow ducked down out of sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>He crawled until the hill hid him from the
Sioux. The river looked a long way ahead,
but now he could run. Sioux warriors on their
horses wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hear the thud of
his feet. He sprinted to the nearest tree before
looking back. When he did, there was no sign
of the Sioux. Evidently they were making
camp in the small valley on the other side of
the hill.</p>
<p>Not until now had Bent Arrow noticed the
throbbing pain in his leg. He slowed his pace
to try to ease it, but it was still hurting badly
when he came to the river.</p>
<p>The sun had gone down before he reached
the river, and darkness was beginning to
shadow everything. Bent Arrow slipped into
the river and swam across. Strangely, when
he crawled out on the bank, the pain in his
leg was much less. He turned downstream,
staying close to the river as it was lighter there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were gone long,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said
when Bent Arrow joined him at the forks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eagle was farther away than I
thought,&rdquo; Bent Arrow explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get an eagle feather?&rdquo; Flying
Arrow asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bent Arrow answered. &ldquo;I almost ran
into the Sioux trying to get one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>He gave Flying Arrow an account of his attempts
to get the feather and of his narrow
escape from the Sioux. He was surprised to
see how discouraged Flying Arrow became as
he told the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem best to postpone our raid,&rdquo;
Flying Arrow said in a voice of disappointment.
&ldquo;Not getting the feather must be a
warning that the raid would be too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can get the feather as we go on
our raid,&rdquo; Bent Arrow suggested. &ldquo;I can find
the spot where it is lodged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow hesitated. It was plain to see
that he was anxious to make the raid, yet he
didn&rsquo;t want to take the added risk of going
against the medicine man&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure that you can find the eagle
feather even in the dark?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Bent Arrow answered positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll make the raid,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
decided. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t, the Sioux will go unpunished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Both Bent Arrow and his uncle mounted
their horses. They rode across the river, but
a short distance on the other side, they dismounted
and tied the horses. From here on,
they must go on foot.</p>
<p>The air had grown much cooler, and dark
clouds were shutting off the little light the
stars gave. Yet Flying Arrow walked along as
surely as though it were broad daylight. While
Bent Arrow was carefully stepping in his
uncle&rsquo;s tracks, he was considering the distance
yet to go. He had gone swiftly, and it had
taken him a long time to go from the Sioux
camping place to the meeting with his uncle.
Would they have time to walk to the Sioux
camp, take horses, and escape before daybreak?</p>
<p>While Bent Arrow was still worrying about
the time that it would take to reach the Sioux
camp, Flying Arrow stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old-Man-of-the-North is sending his wind
at us,&rdquo; he pointed out. &ldquo;We would have to
circle the Sioux camp and approach it from
the south, even if we didn&rsquo;t want to go there
to find the eagle feather.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;What difference will that make?&rdquo; Bent
Arrow demanded, thinking uneasily of the
time they were losing. &ldquo;The Sioux warriors
are not like buffaloes. They can&rsquo;t catch our
scent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their horses can,&rdquo; Flying Arrow explained.
&ldquo;With a storm coming, the horses
will be restless and uneasy. If they catch a
strange scent, they may make enough disturbance
to rouse the Sioux camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought of that,&rdquo; Bent
Arrow acknowledged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well to ask questions,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
assured him. &ldquo;A boy remembers better when
he knows why a thing is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow started on. Now they went
straight south with the wind at their backs.
They were on open ground away from trees,
so they could go rapidly. After a time, Flying
Arrow turned west. He led the way into a
great wide valley. Soon Bent Arrow saw places
where buffaloes had been slaughtered, and he
knew that they were in the valley where he had
seen the Sioux. The Sioux must be camped
by the spring across the hills to the north. In
the middle of the valley, Flying Arrow turned
north and led the way up the dividing hills.
Old-Man-of-the-North&rsquo;s wind was carrying the
odor of smoke and cooked meat. There was no
doubt but that the Sioux were camped just
ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Near the top of the hill, Flying Arrow got
to his hands and knees. Bent Arrow followed
his example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we near the eagle feather?&rdquo; Flying
Arrow asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearer the top of the hill and to our
right,&rdquo; Bent Arrow answered.</p>
<p>The two of them crawled forward and then
to the right. Carefully they searched every
clump of weeds, but they couldn&rsquo;t find the
feather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can delay no longer,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
whispered. &ldquo;Perhaps we must punish the
Sioux to earn such valuable medicine as the
eagle feather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stretched out prone and wriggled toward
the top of the hill. Bent Arrow followed his
uncle&rsquo;s example. At the top of the hill they
could look down into the Sioux camp. There
were no Sioux warriors stirring about, although
the campfire glowed brightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The Sioux camp had been pitched near the
trees. The horses were grazing between the top
of the hill and the sleeping warriors. The glow
of the campfire gave enough light to make it
easier for the raiders to pick the horses they
wanted. At the same time, the horses would
hide Flying Arrow and his nephew from any
watchers in the camp.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow waited as patiently as he could
while his uncle studied the camp. At last
Flying Arrow nodded confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll crawl to the herd and pick the two
horses that I saw this morning,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be easy,&rdquo; Bent Arrow answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often the raid which looks easy is the
most dangerous,&rdquo; Flying Arrow warned. &ldquo;Follow
me. I&rsquo;ll point out the horse you are to
take.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c6"><br /><i>CHAPTER SIX</i></h2>
<p>Bent Arrow smiled happily as he started
to crawl behind his uncle toward the
Sioux horses. He had been afraid that at the
last moment his uncle would think it too dangerous
for him. Evidently Flying Arrow was
convinced that the Sioux had stuffed themselves
with fresh meat and would sleep
soundly. The fact that there were no guards
near the horses showed that the Sioux were
confident that they were safely hidden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Bent Arrow thought proudly how well his
uncle had planned this raid. The Sioux had
gorged themselves. They would sleep soundly.
Only a clumsy, awkward raider would make
enough noise to arouse them. Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
first uneasiness came when Flying Arrow
passed the horses farthest from the sleeping
warriors and continued to crawl nearer the
camp.</p>
<p>The second horse which the two Crows
passed snorted loudly and pranced aside. For
a moment it looked as though the whole herd
would stampede. When the horse had started
to move, Flying Arrow had stretched out on
the ground. Bent Arrow quickly followed his
example. Both of them lay motionless until
the horse quieted and again started grazing.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow waited until he was sure that
no warrior had been roused by the noise. At
last he started ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>By the time he and his uncle had passed
half the horses in the herd, Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
uneasiness was becoming real alarm. The glow
of the campfires had seemed faint when he
watched them from the top of the hill. Here,
close to the Sioux camp, the light seemed
bright. If a Sioux warrior opened his eyes and
looked, he could scarcely fail to see the raiders.
Flying Arrow continued to crawl toward those
fires. At last he halted. He touched Bent
Arrow&rsquo;s arm and pointed to the next horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the horse you are to get,&rdquo; he whispered,
so low that his voice was hardly louder
than the wind rustling through the dry grass.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow turned and crawled toward the
horse. When he had crawled far enough so
that the horse was between him and the fire,
he slowly got to his feet. The horse took an
uneasy step away. Bent Arrow waited patiently
until the horse lowered its head to nibble at
the grass before he moved toward it. The horse
tossed its head and moved ahead several steps.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow stood and helplessly watched
the horse. A shower of sparks flew up at one
of the campfires as a log burned apart. One
end of the log blazed up, throwing light which
would have shown Bent Arrow to any warrior
awake in the camp. Bent Arrow felt the icy
finger of fear along his spine. He wanted to
turn and run for the top of the hill. Somehow
he managed to fight down his panic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>A new plan occurred to him. As quickly as
he dared, he stepped beside another horse.
Luckily this horse stood quietly while Bent
Arrow walked along its side and reached its
head. With the pressure of his hand against
the horse&rsquo;s neck, Bent Arrow guided it toward
the horse he wanted. When he had this horse
beside the other one, he let it stop. He slowly
walked around the horse and went to the side
of the one he had been following. This time
the horse stood quietly while Bent Arrow put
a rope around its neck.</p>
<p>Taking the horse from the herd had to be
done slowly and carefully. Any rapid movement
might arouse a warrior. Bent Arrow had
to hold back his own impatience. By the time
that he had worked his horse out of the herd,
he was about halfway up the hill out of the
valley. Here the shadows were dark, and there
was small danger of being seen even if a Sioux
warrior chanced to waken. A few steps and he
would be across the hill and completely out of
sight of the Sioux camp. The horse suddenly
swung its head, jerking the rope tight. Desperately
Bent Arrow held on. The next
moment the horse stepped quietly ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>As Bent Arrow crossed the top of the hill,
he felt moisture against his cheek. Then he
saw flakes of snow dancing in the air. If he and
Flying Arrow could move swiftly enough, the
snow would hide their trail. Good fortune was
on their side this time. Then he saw the
mounted rider just ahead of him. There was
no chance to escape. At that moment he realized
the rider was Flying Arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get on your horse,&rdquo; Flying Arrow whispered.
&ldquo;We can escape easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow jumped on his horse&rsquo;s back.
Flying Arrow led the way, at first going slowly,
but soon letting his horse run. Bent Arrow
stayed close behind him. So suddenly that
Bent Arrow was taken completely by surprise,
his horse stopped running and started bucking.
Bent Arrow fought to keep his seat. He
stayed on for two wild pitches, but the third
one sent him flying through the air. He landed
with a thud that drove the air from his lungs.</p>
<p>He leaped to his feet, gasping and struggling
to draw air into his lungs. When he did
manage to draw in a lungful of air, he looked
up and saw his horse racing back the way he
had come. Flying Arrow had turned and was
trying to catch the horse, but it had too great
a start. He soon gave up the pursuit and rode
back to Bent Arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<div class="img" id="pic6">

<p class="caption"><i>Bent Arrow fought to keep his seat</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get up behind me,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
both ride this horse. That one will undoubtedly
arouse the Sioux camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow climbed onto the horse behind
his uncle. Flying Arrow turned the animal in
the direction of the place where they had left
their own horses and started it at a gallop.
Snow was falling so fast that the ground was
already blanketed with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I let the horse get away,&rdquo; Bent
Arrow told his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; Flying Arrow assured
him. &ldquo;No rider would have expected
the horse to buck after running so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A load seemed to lift from Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
shoulders. He had been blaming himself bitterly
for losing the horse. He had thought his
uncle must blame him. Instead, the warrior
had seen it as an unavoidable accident.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>The wind began to rise, driving the snow
stinging against the riders&rsquo; faces. Bent Arrow
lowered his head close to his uncle&rsquo;s back to
keep the snow from his eyes. Flying Arrow sat
erect, giving all of his attention to keeping the
horse running in the right direction.</p>
<p>As they rode on, Bent Arrow strained to
catch any sounds of pursuits, but none came.
The driving snow was piling up so that the
horse was leaving a plain trail. However, if
the snow continued, it would soon cover the
trail again.</p>
<p>It was daylight when the two Crows reached
the place where they had left their horses.
Bent Arrow leaped down. Without waiting
for instructions, he gathered up their few
belongings and the remainder of the deer meat.
Flying Arrow dismounted, rolled the supplies
in two bundles, and tied the bundles on one
of the horses. He took the lead rope of that
horse and motioned for Bent Arrow to mount
the other one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better cross the river to find a hiding
place,&rdquo; Flying Arrow decided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Bent Arrow shivered at the thought of getting
in that icy water. However, when they
came to the river, he slid from his horse and
swam beside it to the other shore.</p>
<p>Across the river, Flying Arrow continued
riding straight into the wind. The driving
snow stung their faces and pelted their eyes,
but Flying Arrow continued to lead the way
confidently. Finally he stopped in a sheltered
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horses will be able to get grass here,&rdquo;
he pointed out.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow hobbled the horses while his
uncle started making camp. As soon as he had
cared for the horses, Bent Arrow helped build
a shelter. Flying Arrow showed him how to
lean branches against a small tree to form a
framework. Smaller branches were woven into
the framework, and there was a wall to keep
the snow from their blankets. As soon as the
shelter was completed, both of them searched
for firewood until they had a good supply piled
nearby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Flying Arrow took his and whittled away
the part of a stick that had been wet by the
snow. Then he whittled dry shavings. Bent
Arrow put his robe over his head and took
a corner in each hand. He leaned forward over
the pile of shavings, using his robe as a roof to
protect the kindling from the snow. As soon
as he had enough shavings, Flying Arrow
struck fire with his flint and steel. In a moment
the fire caught. Flying Arrow fed fuel to it
until it burned brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll eat,&rdquo; said Flying Arrow, smiling.</p>
<p>The food tasted so good that for a few
minutes Bent Arrow almost forgot his disappointment
over losing his captured horse. The
snowfall was heavier, and the rising wind was
driving it so that it was sifting through the
branches of the shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sleep now,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said when
they had finished eating. &ldquo;As soon as Old-Man-of-the-North
stops blowing snow at us, we&rsquo;ll
start toward the main camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a captured Sioux horse to lead
into camp,&rdquo; Bent Arrow said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;There will be other raids,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
assured him. &ldquo;Perhaps you will find the eagle
feather which Clawing Bear said you needed.
With it, you&rsquo;ll be sure to capture a Sioux
horse. You almost succeeded without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow rolled up in his robe and
stretched out in the protection of the lean-to.
He lay on his side and pulled the robe high
to protect his face from the snow that sifted
through. In a short time he felt warm. If it
hadn&rsquo;t been that pain began to throb in his
leg, he would have been comfortable. In spite
of the pain, he soon fell asleep.</p>
<p>When Bent Arrow awoke he found himself
in complete darkness. He could see nothing
at all. He started to raise his head, but it
bumped against something soft. He had to
choke back a cry of alarm. While he had been
asleep, some strange spirit must have dragged
him into a deep cave or an animal&rsquo;s den. The
next moment he smiled to himself as he realized
that the snow had drifted over him.
Slowly he raised himself, holding his robe in
a way that kept the snow from sifting down
his neck. When he was out of the drift, Bent
Arrow found that snow was still falling. He
stood up and looked at the sheltering lean-to.
Snow had piled to the top of it and was now
blowing across it. It was the snow blowing
over the lean-to which had covered him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>He glanced toward the mound of snow
which covered Flying Arrow. As Bent Arrow
watched, his uncle stirred and then quickly
crawled out of the drift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old-Man-of-the-North is still sending
snow,&rdquo; Flying Arrow remarked, glancing
around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the sun becomes angry tomorrow
and melts all of his snow,&rdquo; Bent Arrow said
crossly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be better for us if Old-Man-of-the-North
keeps sending snow,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow answered thoughtfully. &ldquo;The storm
will keep the Sioux in that valley. We might
have another chance to make a raid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could we try?&rdquo; Bent Arrow asked eagerly.</p>
<p>Before he answered, Flying Arrow took a
careful look around. He sniffed the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the snow will continue,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;If our horses can get through the
drifts, we have a chance to succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Bent Arrow glanced about him, trying to
decide how much of the day was gone. The
dark clouds and driving snow shut off most
of the light, yet Bent Arrow felt that there
must be a fourth of the day left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there much daylight left?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there were no snow, we could ride to
the Sioux camp before dark,&rdquo; Flying Eagle
answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start at once. It will be
harder traveling after darkness falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow and Bent Arrow went together
to get the horses. Flying Arrow
mounted his own horse, while Bent Arrow
got on Rock. The horse they had captured
from the Sioux was left behind. Flying Arrow
led the way, with Bent Arrow close behind
him. Traveling was difficult. The driving snow
made it hard for them to see. It was impossible
to judge the depth of the drifts. Twice Flying
Arrow started through what looked to be
ordinary drifts only to find them so deep that
the horse couldn&rsquo;t get through. Each time he
had to back the horse out of the drift and
circle around it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>They had gone only a short distance from
camp when Flying Arrow&rsquo;s horse stepped into
a drift and plunged out of sight. Rock reared
and jumped back. As soon as he had his horse
quieted, Bent Arrow dismounted and hurried
to the edge of the drift. He could see his uncle
still on his horse. The drift had filled and
hidden a small ravine. Flying Arrow was trying
to quiet his horse so that it wouldn&rsquo;t injure
itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get on your horse,&rdquo; Flying Arrow ordered.
&ldquo;Toss me your rope. If you can pull me out,
we&rsquo;ll get the horse out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow hurried back to Rock. When
he was mounted, he urged the horse forward.
Rock stepped carefully, and again Bent Arrow
was thankful for this dependable horse. When
he was as close to the edge of the ravine as
he dared go, Bent Arrow pulled the horse to
a stop and tossed one end of the rope down
to his uncle. He looped the other end of the
rope across Rock&rsquo;s shoulder as he had seen
squaws tie travois poles. When Bent Arrow
gave the command, Rock backed slowly away
from the ravine. In a moment Flying Arrow
was safely on the bank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>The moment Flying Arrow was off its back,
his horse started plunging and struggling to
get out. It worked its way forward to a place
where the banks were lower, but still it
couldn&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to pull it out,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said.</p>
<p>He took the rope from Bent Arrow and
tossed a noose over the horse&rsquo;s head. After
he had fixed the noose so it couldn&rsquo;t slip and
choke the horse, he took Bent Arrow&rsquo;s place
on Rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make all the noise you can,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
ordered. &ldquo;Get the horse excited so it will try
to get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow yelled and jumped at the horse.
It had been quiet. Now it scrambled frenziedly
to get out of the ravine. Rock backed
away, pulling on the rope. The hoofs of the
excited horse caught on the edge of the ravine.
It gave a lunge, and at the same time Rock
put all of his weight against the rope. The
horse&rsquo;s hoofs slipped, but it got another footing
and scrambled out. It stood in the snow
blowing and pulling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is too dangerous,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
decided. &ldquo;We almost lost one of our horses.
We&rsquo;ll return to camp and make a better plan
or at least wait until we can travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow tried to hide his disappointment.
Anxious as he was to make another
attempt to capture a Sioux horse, he knew the
wisdom of his uncle&rsquo;s decision. It would be
foolhardy to try to travel in the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the sun will melt most of Old-Man-of-the-North&rsquo;s
snow tomorrow,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be,&rdquo; Flying Arrow agreed doubtfully.</p>
<p>Back at camp, they found that the Sioux
horse had trampled a place in the snow, but
with its feet hobbled, it hadn&rsquo;t been able to
paw any grass free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn the horses loose tonight,&rdquo;
Flying Arrow said. &ldquo;Even then they&rsquo;ll have
trouble getting enough to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they had cared for the horses,
Bent Arrow and his uncle returned to the
shelter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c7"><br /><i>CHAPTER SEVEN</i></h2>
<p>The two Crows cleared most of the snow
away that had drifted onto the sheltered
side of the lean-to. Flying Arrow managed to
blow flame alive on one of the coals still in
the fire. Bent Arrow hunted for more wood,
while the warrior peeled dry shavings and
built the fire up.</p>
<p>While Flying Arrow cooked food over the
fire, Bent Arrow found a large log and
dragged it to the lean-to. As soon as the cooking
was finished, the log could be rolled onto
the fire. It would hold fire all night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must return to our hunting camp,&rdquo;
Flying Arrow said. &ldquo;This storm probably kept
them from starting to the winter camp. If so,
we can join the party and ride with the others.
Next spring, you and I will make another raid
against the Sioux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow thought of how easy it would
be for the Sioux to follow the trail he and
his uncle would leave in the snow. Reluctant
as he was to give up the raid, he understood
the wisdom of Flying Arrow&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we should scout the Sioux camp
before we start back,&rdquo; Bent Arrow suggested.
&ldquo;We might be able to learn something of their
plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow considered the suggestion.
Bent Arrow knew that his uncle was thinking
how valuable it would be to the Crows to
know something of the Sioux plans. And still,
the warrior had to remember that scouting the
Sioux camp would leave a trail in the snow
which might be found. At last Flying Arrow
nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even a scouting trip will be dangerous,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;however we may learn enough to
pay us for taking the risk. If the sun melts
some of the snow in the morning, we&rsquo;ll cross
the river before sunset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although he was tired, Bent Arrow had
trouble falling asleep after he had crawled into
his blankets. When he did fall asleep, he was
bothered by a dream. In the dream he saw an
eagle feather just out of his reach. It seemed
that his uncle was trying to help him, but
there was always a Sioux warrior with an
arrow aimed at him.</p>
<p>As he and his uncle were eating the next
morning, Bent Arrow told of his dream. Flying
Arrow seemed greatly disturbed. He sat
silently for a long time after Bent Arrow had
finished. Finally the warrior got slowly to his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must think about your dream,&rdquo; he told
Bent Arrow. &ldquo;Take care of the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Flying Arrow walked away from the
camp, Bent Arrow left to tend the horses. The
sun was shining brightly, and the snow was
beginning to melt. Bent Arrow found the
horses near where they had left them the night
before. The animals had found a place where
most of the snow had been blown off the grass.
All three of them were eating hungrily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Since the horses were all right and he had
plenty of time, Bent Arrow decided to make
a scouting trip to the river. He picked his way
carefully, avoiding the larger drifts. He found
a place near the river where he could hide
in a clump of brush and watch the other side.</p>
<p>At first there was nothing stirring near him,
but after a while two deer came down to the
other bank of the river. Bent Arrow could tell
from the actions of the deer that no Sioux were
near. He thought of crossing the river and
scouting farther but decided against it. He
waited until the deer left the river before
he left this hiding place to return to camp.
When he arrived, Flying Arrow was waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find a meaning in my dream?&rdquo;
Bent Arrow asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your dream warns of danger from the
Sioux,&rdquo; Flying Arrow answered. &ldquo;Yet it may
promise that we can find your eagle feather
and escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we are to scout the Sioux camp,&rdquo;
Bent Arrow exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; Flying Arrow agreed. &ldquo;There is
nothing in your dream to show that it would
cause us greater danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow insisted that they wait until
the sun was sliding down the western sky
before they started. The sun had melted the
snow so rapidly that there were many bare
spots. However the ground was soft, and the
horses left a plain trail.</p>
<p>They crossed the river at the same place
they did on their other raid. Soon after they
had crossed, they left the horses and went
ahead on foot. As Flying Arrow led the way,
he kept to the bare ground as much as possible.
They came to a small stream which flowed
into the river. They walked along its bank
in a direction which took them farther from
the Sioux camp. When they had gone many
paces, Flying Arrow stepped into the stream
and turned back in the direction from which
they had come. Bent Arrow followed him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The two Crows walked in the cold water
until the stream made a sharp bend. Here
they stepped onto the bank, taking care to
hide their tracks. They circled to the south of
the Sioux camp as they had done the other
time. The sun had sunk in the west, but there
was still some light when the two Crows crept
to the top of the hill and looked down at the
camp.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow gave a little sigh of disappointment
as he saw that the horses had been put
into a pole corral. He had been hoping that
he and his uncle might have a chance to take
one or two of the Sioux horses. As he looked
more closely at the camp, he noticed bundles
hanging in the trees. It was too far for him to
be able to see clearly, but he guessed the
bundles must be meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be planning to camp here for
a while,&rdquo; Bent Arrow whispered to his uncle.
&ldquo;They have their meat hanging on tree
limbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or they are planning to make a raid before
they start to winter camp,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
whispered back. &ldquo;The meat would be safe
from wolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be against our Crow camp.&rdquo; In
his excitement Bent Arrow almost spoke
aloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Flying Arrow nodded grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to learn their plans,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic7">
<img src="images/i11.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" />
<p class="caption">{<i>The two Crows crept to the top of the hill</i>}</p>
</div>
<p>There was a wide space of open hillside
between the two Crows and the Sioux camp.
Bent Arrow knew they dared not cross it until
the Sioux camp was asleep. He knew that his
uncle would learn much about the Sioux plans
just from watching the camp. He settled down
beside his uncle, determined that he, too,
would learn of their plans by watching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Flying Arrow suddenly reached over and
gripped Bent Arrow&rsquo;s arm. At the same
moment Bent Arrow saw a Sioux warrior ride
across the hill at the far side of the valley. The
warrior was leading three horses. Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
heart sank. Rock was one of those horses. He
and his uncle were far from the Crow camp,
and now they had no horses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Losing their mounts was only part of the
danger in which Bent Arrow and his uncle
found themselves. The Sioux warrior who
had taken the horses was sure to have studied
the trail left by the Crows. He would know
that a warrior and a boy had made the trail.
He wouldn&rsquo;t have had to follow the trail to
know that the two Crows would be near the
Sioux camp. Unless darkness fell quickly,
Sioux warriors would find the two Crows
before they had a chance to escape. For a
while the danger made Bent Arrow forget the
disgrace of having lost their horses to a raider.</p>
<p>With a pressure on Bent Arrow&rsquo;s arm, Flying
Arrow warned that they must leave at
once. They crawled back until it was safe for
them to stand. Flying Arrow led the way southeast,
trying to avoid stepping in snow where
their tracks would easily be seen. Bent Arrow
came to a sudden stop. He stepped aside to
get a closer look at the thing which had
attracted his attention. He gave a low exclamation.
He had found an eagle feather.</p>
<p>He realized that this was the place where he
had watched the Sioux butchering buffaloes.
This was the eagle feather which he hadn&rsquo;t
dared try to pick up that afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Flying Arrow had stopped and was watching
Bent Arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my eagle feather,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
exclaimed, holding the feather for his uncle
to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be too late,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
answered grimly. &ldquo;We must go fast if we are
to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the two Crows went rapidly, they
did not seem to be getting any great distance
from the Sioux camp. In trying to pick his
way where there was no snow, Flying Arrow
followed a zigzag course. Bent Arrow gave his
attention to planting his feet in his uncle&rsquo;s
tracks. Occasionally he did stop and look back.
Each time he expected to see the Sioux riding
toward them.</p>
<p>Darkness should have fallen quickly. Now,
it seemed to be holding off. When it did come,
it wasn&rsquo;t deep; the sky was clear, and the
snowdrifts reflected the starlight. Bent Arrow
glanced back. A Sioux warrior was coming
across the hill behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux are coming,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
warned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Without wasting time to look back, Flying
Arrow threw himself on the ground. Bent
Arrow stretched out beside him. There was a
ditch to the left. Flying Arrow crawled toward
it, with Bent Arrow close behind him. Both
of them rolled over the edge and to the bottom
of the ditch.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow scarcely noticed the trickle of
cold water which thoroughly wet his clothing.
When Flying Arrow got to his feet, bent
double so that his head was below the edge of
the ditch, Bent Arrow followed. They walked
carefully until they came to a place where a
clump of brush grew at the edge of the bank.
Flying Arrow cupped his hands, making a
stirrup. Bent Arrow understood what he was
to do. He stepped beside his uncle, placed a
foot in the cupped hands, and was lifted up
until his head was just above the edge of the
draw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>When Bent Arrow tried to look around for
a sight of the enemy, he found that the brush
shut off his view. He moved one foot gently
as a warning to his uncle. Then stepped up
on Flying Arrow&rsquo;s shoulder. From there he
crawled out onto the bank, keeping hidden
under the branches of the shrubs. He wormed
himself forward until he could see out over the
valley. The Sioux warrior was riding along the
bank of the ditch only a few paces away. Bent
Arrow tossed a tiny stick into the ditch as a
warning to his uncle. Then he crept under
the brush and waited.</p>
<p>With one ear pressed against the ground,
Bent Arrow could follow the approach of the
Sioux warrior almost as well as he could have
had he dared watch. Once the warrior stopped
his horse, and Bent Arrow&rsquo;s heart stopped
beating. Before Bent Arrow could decide
whether or not he should jump to his feet
and run, the Sioux moved on. Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
heart began to beat again.</p>
<p>After the warrior had gone on, Bent Arrow
lay still, waiting for a signal from his uncle.
At last Flying Arrow tapped the wall of the
ditch lightly. Bent Arrow crawled to the edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux will come back on the other
side,&rdquo; Flying Arrow whispered in Bent
Arrow&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to stay here until he
returns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Bent Arrow crawled back to his hiding
place. He took another look up the valley. He
thought he saw a Sioux warrior far to the
other side, but in the darkness he couldn&rsquo;t
be sure. He caught the sound of the first Sioux
warrior returning on the other side of the
ditch. Bent Arrow crawled under the brush
and lay motionless. As soon as the warrior was
safely out of sight, Flying Arrow crawled up
onto the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When daylight comes, the Sioux will find
our trail,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll travel as fast
as we can go now. Later we&rsquo;ll try to hide our
trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow led the way. He tried to find
the easiest route, but he made little effort to
hide their trail. He led the way out of the
valley that they were in, across some low hills
and into another valley. He continued on
until they came to a small, tree-lined stream.
He stepped into the stream, and Bent Arrow
followed him.</p>
<p>Although the stream was small, it flowed
swiftly, making it difficult to walk against
the current. In spite of Bent Arrow&rsquo;s care, he
was soon drenched with the water he splashed.
Flying Arrow continued to stay in the stream
until he came to a large tree with branches
spreading across the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Flying Arrow leaped up and caught hold
of a stout limb. He swung himself up and
crawled onto the limb. Bent Arrow had to
jump a second time before he managed to
grab the limb. When he did get hold of it, he
swung himself behind his uncle. Flying Arrow
crawled along the limb to the trunk of the
tree. He found a large limb extending on the
other side of the tree. He crawled as near
the end of it as he could and then dropped to
the ground. Bent Arrow dropped down beside
him.</p>
<p>There was only a little snow under the tree,
but it was enough to leave plain footprints.
Flying Arrow found a small branch. Using it
as a broom, he swept away the tracks which
they had made. There was another tree a few
paces from the one the Crows were under.
Flying Arrow pointed to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll jump from here to the next tree,&rdquo;
Flying Arrow told Bent Arrow. &ldquo;You go first.
I&rsquo;ll brush out any tracks you make in the
snow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Bent Arrow stepped back to the trunk of the
tree. From there he ran forward and jumped
as far as he could. He landed among the low
branches of the next tree. A moment later his
uncle landed beside him. There were no other
trees near, and all around was snow which
would plainly show any tracks that were made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ride on my back,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
ordered. &ldquo;You can carry a branch and brush
away my tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow picked up a small branch.
Holding it in one hand, he got on his uncle&rsquo;s
back. Each time that Flying Arrow took a step,
Bent Arrow leaned down and brushed the
footprints away. This left odd markings in
the snow. If the sun shone even a short time
before the Sioux found the trail, there would
be little they could read in it.</p>
<p>It was slow progress across the valley and
to the top of the hill. Here the ground was
bare. Bent Arrow jumped from his uncle&rsquo;s
back. Now they were able to go rapidly. As
they went on, they did find patches of snow,
but they jumped across these.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>As he and his uncle hurried along, Bent
Arrow noticed that the darkness was deepening.
He glanced toward the sky. Clouds were
blotting out the stars. A short time later, he
felt snowflakes hitting against his face. Flying
Arrow turned from the chain of hills and led
the way into a valley where there were a few
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can camp now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Old-Man-of-the-North
is sending more snow. It will
cover our trail. The Sioux won&rsquo;t be able to
find us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he had sent it earlier, we wouldn&rsquo;t have
had to run from the Sioux,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
exclaimed bitterly.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a good Crow,&rdquo; he praised. &ldquo;No
Crow likes to run from the Sioux. Some day
we shall repay them for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the darkness Bent Arrow and his uncle
groped under a tree until they found a pile
of leaves. Carefully they raked the wet leaves
from the pile. They bunched the dry leaves
together and burrowed into the pile. Although
they had no blankets, they soon were dry and
comfortable. Bent Arrow had scarcely crawled
into the leaves before he fell into a sound
sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c8"><br /><i>CHAPTER EIGHT</i></h2>
<p>When Bent Arrow awakened, he brushed
the leaves from his face and lifted his
head. It was bright daylight. The ground had
been covered with a light blanket of snow,
but it was no longer storming. The clouds
overhead were beginning to break up. At any
moment the sun might shine through.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow stirred and sat up beside Bent
Arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to find food for us while you start
a fire,&rdquo; Flying Arrow directed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Bent Arrow searched in piles of leaves until
he had gathered an armload of dry sticks. He
laid these on the ground. Next he raked
together a small pile of dry leaves. He struck
a spark on the pile of leaves and blew the
sparks to a flame. He added small sticks of
dry wood until the fire burned brightly. By
the time Flying Arrow returned with a deer
which he had killed and dressed, the fire was
a mass of glowing coals.</p>
<p>While the food was cooking, Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
mind was puzzling with the question of what
plan he and his uncle could follow. Probably
Flying Arrow would announce that they
would start at once to try to rejoin their own
hunting party. Bent Arrow thought it likely
that the hunters had already started toward
the Crow winter camp. Unless he and his
uncle could overtake the party, they would
have to travel all the distance on foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that we will have to walk to
the winter camp,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said, as
though he were guessing Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone will laugh at us,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
replied thoughtfully. &ldquo;Not only have we
failed to capture Sioux horses, but we have lost
our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one will laugh at us,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
assured him. &ldquo;Many raids are unsuccessful.
It will be an almost-victory if the two of us
escape so large a Sioux hunting party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow looked at his uncle in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux won&rsquo;t look for us since the
storm, will they?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not likely to hunt for us unless&rdquo;&mdash;,
Flying Arrow let his voice fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were thinking that we might follow
them,&rdquo; Bent Arrow guessed. &ldquo;You would like
to try one more raid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile briefly touched the corners of Flying
Arrow&rsquo;s mouth. It was quickly replaced
by a thoughtful frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our raids have been unsuccessful,&rdquo; he said
gloomily. &ldquo;The Sioux have strong medicine.
Our medicine is weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow had forgotten the eagle feather
inside his shirt. As he shifted to a more comfortable
position, the feather rubbed lightly
against his skin. He reached his hand inside
his shirt and drew out the feather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our medicine was weak,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s strong now. I have the eagle feather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow started to shake his head. He
stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed yesterday that you did not limp
even though we walked and ran a great distance,&rdquo;
he admitted. &ldquo;The eagle feather may
be helping us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Old-Man-of-the-North sent snow to
hide our tracks,&rdquo; Bent Arrow went on. &ldquo;Our
medicine is stronger than the Sioux&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem to be,&rdquo; Flying Arrow acknowledged.
&ldquo;I must think more about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow quickly got to his feet and
walked away. He must say no more. Already
he had spoken more than a boy should. He
noticed that the sun had not kept its promise
to break through the clouds. The north wind
was damp and chilly; every gust seemed sure
to bring more snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Old-Man-of-the-North doesn&rsquo;t send
more snow,&rdquo; Bent Arrow thought to himself.</p>
<p>When Bent Arrow left the camp, he crossed
the small valley and climbed to the highest
point on the hills that divided the valley from
the next one. He saw a few buffaloes grazing
there. That was proof enough that the Sioux
were not near.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>When Bent Arrow returned to camp, he
found Flying Arrow busily dividing the best
parts of the deer meat into two packs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow the Sioux two days,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow announced. &ldquo;If, by that time, we
haven&rsquo;t been able to make a raid, we must
turn toward our winter camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow wanted to shout his joy at
his uncle&rsquo;s decision. He could feel the Crow
war cry climbing up his throat, and he had
to clamp his mouth shut to make sure that he
didn&rsquo;t shout. If Flying Arrow noticed Bent
Arrow&rsquo;s excitement, he gave no sign.</p>
<p>In a very short time they were on their way,
each of them carrying a small pack of meat.
When he and his uncle had fled from the
Sioux, they had gone southeast and then circled
west. Now Flying Arrow was swinging
toward the north.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Flying Arrow set a fast pace. Several times
he cast an anxious look back at Bent Arrow,
but the boy was following easily. The weather
had changed again. Evidently the sun had remembered
its promise. It had chased the
clouds away and was busily melting the snow.
At midday, when Flying Arrow called a halt,
the blanket of snow was gone, with only scattered
drifts left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cook all of our meat,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
announced. &ldquo;This will be the last fire we can
have until we complete our raid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the afternoon wore on, Bent Arrow
became more and more uneasy. One of the
two promised days was rapidly being spent,
and still there had been no trace of the Sioux
trail. If Flying Arrow had misjudged the route
the Sioux would take, the last chance to make
a raid would be gone. To add to Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
troubles, his leg began to ache. The ache increased
rapidly until the pain was so great that
he could hardly walk without limping. It was
the first time the leg had pained him since he
had found the eagle feather. Perhaps Clawing
Bear had been wrong. Perhaps the eagle
feather wasn&rsquo;t the medicine which would
bring victory. Resolutely he put the thought
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Bent Arrow kept his head down and put
every effort into walking without a limp. He
promised himself that he wouldn&rsquo;t let Flying
Arrow know that his leg was hurting. The
warrior would insist on stopping, and that
would mean the chance to make the raid was
gone. However, Flying Arrow was too intent
on finding the best route to glance back. In
spite of the pain, Bent Arrow managed to
keep going until Flying Arrow stopped beside
a small stream.</p>
<p>Both Crows drank their fill of the cold
water. They made a meal of the cold meat and
prepared for the night.</p>
<p>The eastern sky was just beginning to light
up when Flying Arrow touched Bent Arrow
on the shoulder. Hesitantly Bent Arrow got
to his feet and took a few careful steps. He
was elated to find that there was no pain in
his leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has pleased you so much?&rdquo; Flying
Arrow asked, glancing at Bent Arrow&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My leg was hurting me yesterday when
we stopped,&rdquo; Bent Arrow explained. &ldquo;I was
afraid it wasn&rsquo;t cured. It&rsquo;s all right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He danced a few steps of the Crow war
dance to show how completely his leg was
healed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we should give up this raid and go
directly to the winter camp,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
said thoughtfully. &ldquo;We could travel slowly.
Your leg must not be completely healed or it
would not have hurt you yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; Bent Arrow insisted. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t want to return to winter camp empty-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the determination of a good
Crow warrior,&rdquo; he praised.</p>
<p>They made a quick meal of cold meat and
set off again. They had gone only a short distance
when they came upon the Sioux trail.
The trail was plainly marked, although most
of the snow had melted since the Sioux had
passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they are going directly to their
winter camp,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said. &ldquo;They are
farther ahead than I had expected.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>The Sioux trail led almost due north. For
a time it lay in the level valley of the stream.
When it left the valley, it followed much
rougher ground. There were steep hills surrounding
narrow valleys which were little
more than canyons. Some of the valleys had
wooded streams; others were only a dip in the
prairie. In spite of the rough ground, Flying
Arrow kept at his swift pace.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the sun was directly overhead
that Flying Arrow halted beside a small
stream. Both he and Bent Arrow drank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does your leg hurt?&rdquo; Flying Arrow asked,
as he got to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Bent Arrow assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go on at once,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
decided. &ldquo;We must lose no time if we are to
overtake the Sioux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the trail led away from the hills and
out onto the open prairie. In every direction
the dried grass looked like a great brown sea.
The low hills were like rolling waves. Occasionally
the two Crows came to a valley where
a few trees grew beside a stream. The sun
was about halfway down the western sky when
they came into a valley which had a larger
grove of trees than the others. The nearer they
came to the trees, the faster Flying Arrow
went, so that he was running at full speed
when he reached the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is as I had hoped,&rdquo; he called, pointing
to the signs of a recent camp. &ldquo;The Sioux
camped here last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow felt a wave of triumph. He and
his uncle were getting closer to the Sioux. He
was to have another chance to take part in a
raid against their enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can keep traveling, we&rsquo;ll overtake
them tonight,&rdquo; Flying Arrow assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can keep traveling,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
answered confidently.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow led on at a rapid pace. There
was no need to take time to study the trail.
The Sioux had been so sure that no one would
follow them that they hadn&rsquo;t tried to hide their
trail. It was not quite dark when Flying Arrow
stopped and studied the signs with a puzzled
frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux stopped here,&rdquo; he pointed out.
&ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow crossed to the other side of
the trail, carefully studying the marks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Uncle,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Another
Sioux joined them here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Flying Arrow came quickly to Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
side. He studied the hoofprints left by one
horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been a scout,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
said after he had examined the trail carefully.
&ldquo;He must have been sent out the night before.
If we had studied the camping place carefully,
we would have seen his trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came from the direction where our
hunting party was camped,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
answered worriedly.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow studied the trail left by the
one rider. Then he turned his attention to the
trail left by the Sioux party as they rode on.
He pointed out to Bent Arrow that the scout
had stayed with the main party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have brought back news that our
hunting party had moved on,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
said. &ldquo;The Sioux didn&rsquo;t turn aside. Let&rsquo;s
hurry. We want to follow as far as possible
before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow motioned for Bent Arrow
to travel at his side. They had gone only a
short distance when both of them stopped as
though halted by an invisible fence. The
Sioux trail turned sharply to the west.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;They went that way because it&rsquo;s easier
traveling,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said. &ldquo;I think I know
where they are camped. We&rsquo;ll take a shorter
route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow wanted to protest. Perhaps
Flying Arrow&rsquo;s reading of the trail had been
wrong. Yet Flying Arrow was following so
confidently the diagonal course he had set that
Bent Arrow&rsquo;s doubts began to fade.</p>
<p>The light dimmed rapidly. Even after darkness
had blanketed the prairie, Flying Arrow
kept up his rapid, sure pace. Several times
Bent Arrow reached inside his shirt and felt
of the eagle feather. Each time he did, his
confidence mounted. In the last two days he
had traveled as far as a warrior could have
gone, and his leg wasn&rsquo;t hurting at all. Clawing
Bear&rsquo;s prophecy that an eagle feather would
complete the cure had come true. His prophecy
that it would protect Bent Arrow from
the Sioux would surely be equally true.</p>
<p>At last Flying Arrow called a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux were not traveling fast,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;We are near their camp. We&rsquo;ll rest a
while before we try to make a raid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Bent Arrow looked at his uncle in surprised
wonder. Flying Arrow seemed as sure of the
Sioux camping place as if he had seen them
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you be sure?&rdquo; Bent Arrow asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read the signs of the Sioux trail,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow explained. &ldquo;I know much about the
Sioux, and I know the only good camping
place for a large party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow had already fixed a comfortable
place to rest. Bent Arrow found a
clump of tall, dry grass. He curled up in that
to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll waken you when it&rsquo;s time to start,&rdquo;
Flying Arrow promised.</p>
<p>It seemed to Bent Arrow that he had hardly
fallen asleep when he was roused by his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make our plans before we start,&rdquo;
Flying Arrow said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Flying Arrow carefully described the place
where the Sioux were camped. It was a rather
small valley. There was a narrow entrance at
the south end, but the rest of the valley was
ringed in with steep hills. It wasn&rsquo;t impossible
for horses to get up the hills, but it was difficult
and dangerous. There were a spring and
a few trees near the north side. That was where
the Sioux would be camped. Since the Sioux
had no idea anyone was pursuing them, they
would leave the horses loose to graze over the
valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can slip into the valley, get two horses
apiece, and be far from here before the Sioux
learn of their loss,&rdquo; Flying Arrow concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is small punishment for the trouble
they have caused us,&rdquo; Bent Arrow pointed
out. &ldquo;We should take all of their horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be possible,&rdquo; Flying Arrow agreed
excitedly. &ldquo;If you can catch Rock, this is the
plan we&rsquo;ll use. Truly the Sioux will be punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly Flying Arrow outlined his new
plan. Bent Arrow nodded from time to time.
He could see no flaw. If it worked, the Sioux
would be well punished. If it didn&rsquo;t work,
Bent Arrow and his uncle would still get some
Sioux horses. He reached inside his shirt and
felt of the eagle feather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c9"><br /><i>CHAPTER NINE</i></h2>
<p>Although there was no moon, the stars
in the clear sky gave enough light so
that Bent Arrow and his uncle could see well
enough to travel swiftly. When they reached
the rim of the valley where they could look
down into the Sioux camp, they saw a grove
at the far end. The glowing embers of the
campfire marked the place where the Sioux
were sleeping. The horses were scattered
about the valley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>While Flying Arrow was watching the camp
to make sure no Sioux warrior was moving
about, Bent Arrow was looking over the
horses. Much of the chance of success of their
plan depended upon Bent Arrow recapturing
Rock. Had it been daylight, the boy would
have had no trouble picking Rock out in the
herd. In the darkness it was much more difficult.
The horses were dark shadows, too faint
to be told apart. At last Bent Arrow spotted
a horse which was grazing apart from the
others. Gently he touched Flying Arrow&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that is Rock alone on the far side
of the herd,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow turned his head to look in
that direction. He watched the horse carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;You
crawl to him. By the time you get to him, I
will have a horse. We must work swiftly.
Everything depends upon being able to surprise
the Sioux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow reached inside his shirt and
touched the eagle feather. He felt a great wave
of confidence. This time there would be no
failure. His medicine was more powerful than
any the Sioux could have.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>He crawled down the hill a short distance
toward the Sioux camp. It would have been
easier to go along the rim to a point directly
above Rock, but he would have been shadowed
against the sky line. He would have been
visible to any Sioux warrior who might have
chanced to look up.</p>
<p>While Bent Arrow was still some distance
away, Rock raised his head and sniffed suspiciously.
For a terrible moment Bent Arrow
was sure the horse was going to run. Rock
sniffed again and then took a hesitant step
toward Bent Arrow. Now was the time. Slowly
Bent Arrow got to his feet. Rock stood quietly
as Bent Arrow approached. A moment later
Bent Arrow was on the horse&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow looked around. He saw his
uncle mounting a horse. A moment later the
wild Crow battle cry rang out. Bent Arrow
sent Rock charging at the nearest horse. When
that horse turned and raced toward the campfire,
Rock charged another one. It was a wild,
blurred time as Bent Arrow kept his horse
circling the herd and stampeding it toward
the campfire. From the noise at the other side
of the herd, he could tell that Flying Arrow
was being equally successful. It took only a
very few minutes completely to stampede the
herd and send it charging straight at the
Sioux camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>The Sioux warriors had been aroused. They
had sprung up and were waving their arms
and shouting, trying to stop the horses, but
they were too late. The wild stampede could
not be stopped. For a few moments the Sioux
bravely held their ground, but at the last
moment they turned and dashed into the
grove of trees for protection. The horses
swerved around the grove and raced on across
the valley.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow kept Rock close on the heels
of the last horse on one side of the herd.
Flying Arrow was riding close to the last horse
on the other side.</p>
<p>The moment the horses veered to go around
the trees, the Sioux warriors sprang into
action. Arrows whistled around Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
head as he crouched low over Rock&rsquo;s neck. It
took only a moment for the horses to get out of
bowshot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>

<p class="caption"><i>Arrows whistled around his head</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>The horses continued their wild stampede
across the valley and started up the hill at the
other side. Here they were slowed. The hill
was so steep that the horses plunged and
struggled to move forward at all. Again
arrows whistled around Bent Arrow&rsquo;s head.
The Sioux had raced across the level valley to
the foot of the hills. The slower speed of the
horses had given the warriors a chance to
get within range again. A horse, a little to the
left and just ahead of Bent Arrow, crumpled
to the ground. Bent Arrow felt a searing pain
along his left shoulder.</p>
<p>The volley of arrows broke off suddenly.
At first, Bent Arrow thought they had again
got out of range. A quick look over his
shoulder showed him this wasn&rsquo;t true. The
Sioux were dangerously close. Then he realized
that the warriors were so sure they would
recapture their horses that they were taking
no chances of arrows hitting any more of them.
And then, unexpectedly, Bent Arrow found
himself at the top of the hill. The herd of
horses was again running at a wild speed.
Bent Arrow raised his voice in the triumphant
Crow victory cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>While Bent Arrow&rsquo;s yell was still ringing
out, one of the Sioux horses suddenly swerved
and tried to escape. Rock wheeled and headed
it off. Another one tried to turn back. Rock
got it back into the herd, only to have to chase
two others. The herd was scarcely moving
forward at all. It was plain to see why the
Sioux had quit shooting. They had known
that the horses would be hard to drive. As
the horses became more and more difficult to
manage, Bent Arrow&rsquo;s heart sank. The Sioux
wouldn&rsquo;t even have to hurry to catch them.</p>
<p>A horse broke out of the herd and was
racing back before Rock could swerve to cut it
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go,&rdquo; Flying Arrow shouted.</p>
<p>As though understanding the warrior&rsquo;s
order, Rock swung back behind the herd.
Bent Arrow saw two horses escape near his
uncle. Another one broke away in front of
Rock, but at last the rest of the herd was
beginning to run again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>The herd of horses strung out ahead of the
two Crows. The speed was slower than it had
been in that wild stampede at the Sioux
camp, but it was fast enough to run away from
warriors on foot. The Sioux would have to
recapture the escaped horses in order to have
a chance to overtake the herd. At the top of
the next hill Flying Arrow stopped his horse
to look back, while Bent Arrow kept the herd
moving ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Sioux are following, they aren&rsquo;t
close,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said as he rejoined Bent
Arrow.</p>
<p>He noticed the blood on Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have a look at that wound,&rdquo; he
ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. We shouldn&rsquo;t lose any time,&rdquo;
Bent Arrow protested.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Flying Arrow cut away the
sleeve and examined the wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t stop bleeding soon, we&rsquo;ll stop
and apply a poultice,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Bent Arrow insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t stop bleeding soon, you are
to tell me,&rdquo; Flying Arrow ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux will lose time trying to catch
those horses that got away from us, won&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; Bent Arrow asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;They will,&rdquo; Flying Arrow agreed. &ldquo;But,
when they do catch them, they&rsquo;ll go faster than
we can. Driving this herd will slow us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before Flying Arrow&rsquo;s words
were proved true. The herd, which hadn&rsquo;t
been running very fast, slowed to an easy trot.
In spite of the efforts of the two Crows, the
horses would not increase their speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must find some way to slow the Sioux,&rdquo;
Flying Arrow said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow didn&rsquo;t have an opportunity to
answer. Two horses at the head of the herd
had slowed to a walk; others were reluctant to
pass the leaders, and the whole herd was going
at a dangerously slow pace. Bent Arrow
crowded his horse against the nearest one in
the herd, trying to get it past the leaders. It
was while he was failing that he thought of
his plan. He reined his horse beside Flying
Arrow&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux will stop to catch every horse we
leave, won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Bent Arrow asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re sure to do that,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
agreed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve probably delayed to catch
the horses that escaped from our herd.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;With Rock I can cut out one of those lead
horses,&rdquo; Bent Arrow pointed out. &ldquo;Later we
can cut out another one and cause another
delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe your plan will work,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow exclaimed. &ldquo;The mounted riders will
stop and catch each horse. Very likely they&rsquo;ll
wait while one warrior takes the captured
horse back to those on foot so that there&rsquo;ll be
another warrior to join the chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow pulled Rock to one side so that
he wouldn&rsquo;t cause the herd to turn. He urged
the horse forward until he was just behind the
two leaders. Rock seemed to understand what
was wanted. He dashed between the two lead
horses and crowded one of them to the side.
He kept that horse away from the others, while
the herd moved on. As soon as he had the
horse far enough away, Bent Arrow turned
Rock to rejoin the herd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The horse that had been driven out of the
herd followed for a considerable distance. Bent
Arrow was about to give up hope that the
plan would work, when the horse stopped to
graze. In his mind Bent Arrow could see the
four mounted Sioux riding into sight of the
horse. The warriors would expect an ambush.
They would wait and watch carefully before
trying to catch the horse. If the horse ran
away, there would be more delay.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow had been so busy that he had
scarcely noticed when darkness had given way
to daylight. As the sun climbed steadily into
the eastern sky, he became more and more
confident that he and his uncle would escape.
But as Bent Arrow&rsquo;s confidence grew, Flying
Arrow appeared to become more worried. Several
times he anxiously examined Bent Arrow&rsquo;s
shoulder. Each time they crossed a small
stream, he dismounted and dug in the mud
beside the water. About the middle of the
morning, he ordered Bent Arrow to cut out
another horse.</p>
<p>They came to a small stream at midday.
The horses drank and then were allowed to
graze. Flying Arrow again dug into the mud
along the bank. This time he stood up, holding
a handful of odd-colored mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will help heal your wound,&rdquo; he told
Bent Arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Flying Arrow watched as Bent Arrow
washed the blood and dirt away from the
wound. As soon as it was clean, he applied the
mud over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have lost much blood,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; Bent Arrow insisted.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was glad to stretch out on
the grass. He fell asleep almost at once. It
seemed he had scarcely closed his eyes when
Flying Arrow called that it was time to start.</p>
<p>All morning the herd had been kept going
northwest. When it was started after the midday
rest, Flying Arrow turned it directly west.
The horses had become much more manageable.
They quickly fell into a steady trot.
Whenever they crossed high hills, Flying Arrow
stopped to see if pursuers came into sight,
while Bent Arrow kept the herd moving. Each
time Flying Arrow reported that he had seen
no sign of the Sioux.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may have given up the chase,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow said doubtfully after the third such
scouting trip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>While he may have hoped that the Sioux had
given up, Flying Arrow did not change his
plans. The horses were kept moving steadily
forward. While the sun was still high in the
western sky, he had Bent Arrow turn another
horse away from the herd.</p>
<p>As he and his uncle kept the horses moving,
Bent Arrow found himself getting more and
more tired. His eyes grew heavy, too, so that
it was a struggle to keep them open. To add to
his discomfort, the horses began to give trouble
again. They no longer tried to turn back,
but they continually stopped to graze. Bent
Arrow was thankful that he had dependable
Rock to do the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you keep going?&rdquo; Flying Arrow asked
anxiously. &ldquo;There is a good place for us to
camp not far ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep going,&rdquo; Bent Arrow promised.</p>
<p>Keeping the promise proved harder than
making it. It took all of Bent Arrow&rsquo;s determination
to keep his eyes open. The sun had
dropped behind the western hills, and darkness
was closing in. Still Flying Arrow urged
them on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>To Bent Arrow it seemed that they kept
moving forever. In spite of his best efforts, his
eyes would close. Once he caught himself slipping
from Rock&rsquo;s back. He got off and walked,
hoping that the exercise would waken him.
It did rouse him, but he was too tired to walk
far. When he did remount, he had to struggle
to get back on his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little farther,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
encouraged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be at Bear Trap Canyon.
There I can watch while you rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow had been dimly aware of a
darker shadow looming ahead of them. He
realized that this was Bear Trap Canyon.
Actually the canyon was only a narrow cup,
circled by hills which rose up out of the prairie.
On both sides the hills rose so steeply that it
was almost impossible for a man to get up the
sides. Bent Arrow remembered having heard
warriors talk about the hills. He knew the only
opening into the canyon was a narrow slit
which they were approaching.</p>
<p>At the opening the herd of horses balked.
Bent Arrow had awakened enough so that he
was able to do his share, but all their efforts
were not enough to force the horses to enter
the opening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ride Rock through,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
ordered. &ldquo;Maybe the other horses will follow
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow guided Rock to the entrance.
Rock snorted uneasily but, under Bent
Arrow&rsquo;s urging, carefully picked his way between
the steep walls. The passage was narrow
and covered with stones. However, in a few
paces it widened. Flying Arrow had been able
to get the other horses to follow Rock. At last
the entire herd was safely in the canyon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch while you sleep,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
said. &ldquo;Later, you will watch while I sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow knew that he should protest.
Since sundown his uncle had done most of the
work of keeping the herd moving. He should
have the first rest. But the words wouldn&rsquo;t
come. Bent Arrow stretched out on the ground
and immediately fell asleep.</p>
<p>When Bent Arrow awoke, daylight was
beginning to light up the eastern sky. He looked
reproachfully at his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were to awaken me,&rdquo; he protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;You were wounded and needed the rest
more than I,&rdquo; Flying Arrow answered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
take a look at your shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way to the spring in the middle
of the canyon. Bent Arrow crouched down
while his uncle washed away the dried mud.
Flying Arrow gave a low grunt of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is doing well,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know that the sore is there,&rdquo; Bent
Arrow assured him. &ldquo;Now you must rest while
I watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First I&rsquo;ll ride back a way to see if there is
any sign of the Sioux,&rdquo; Flying Arrow replied.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow wanted to protest, but he knew
that it would do no good. Flying Arrow would
think it his duty to see that every possible
precaution was taken. Very likely, when he
returned, he would order Bent Arrow to
waken him soon so that they could start on.
Fortunately they still had small packets of
dried meat, and as soon as they had eaten,
Flying Arrow mounted one of the horses and
rode out of the canyon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Bent Arrow felt entirely rested. The wound
in his shoulder was hardly noticeable. Since
the horses were grazing quietly, he decided to
explore the canyon while he waited for his
uncle to return. The teacher had told the boys
much about this canyon. It was a place of good
omen for the Crows. Sometimes, when a warrior
had been unsuccessful in raids, he would
come here. He would climb the wall and lie
on the rim. While he slept, he was sure to
have a dream that would lead him to better
raids.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow started walking around the canyon,
looking at the walls in the hope of finding
the place where the warriors climbed to the
top. He made a complete round of the walls
without finding a place. He started around
again. At the far side, he noticed a place where
the wall appeared rough enough so that he
might be able to climb it. He glanced back
at the horses. They were grazing quietly. He
decided to see how far he could climb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>For several feet, he was able to go easily
by stepping from one small ledge to another.
Then he came to a place where the wall was
smooth. There was a ledge above the one he
was on, but it was out of his reach. Determined
not to give up, he took his knife and
gouged out a place above his head so that he
could get a grip with his hands. He made
another place just above his knees. He reached
up and dug his hands into the place he had
made above his head. He put his toes in the
other place. Slowly he pulled himself up. He
reached one hand up and managed to grasp
the rim of the ledge. Carefully he put his
weight on that hand. The ledge was solid. He
gripped it with the other hand and pulled
himself up. Above the ledge the wall was not
so steep. Bent Arrow easily made his way to
the top. From his vantage point, he could look
far out over the prairie. He saw nothing
moving until he looked in the direction
Flying Arrow had taken. There he saw Flying
Arrow racing back toward the canyon.
Flying Arrow&rsquo;s speed meant danger.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow turned back and went down the
way he had come up. Getting down was easy,
and he was waiting at the entrance when Flying
Arrow dashed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux are less than half a sun&rsquo;s march
from us!&rdquo; Flying Arrow cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c10"><br /><i>CHAPTER TEN</i></h2>
<p>Bent Arrow looked at his uncle in dismay.
It seemed unbelievable that they had traveled
all of that distance the day before without
seeing a sign of pursuit and now the Sioux
were almost upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux are smart,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said
bitterly. &ldquo;They knew we must stop sometime
to rest. This place is on the way to our camping
grounds. It is a place where we can leave
our horses unwatched. The Sioux thought of
those things and the mounted warriors took
a short cut to get here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;How many Sioux are there?&rdquo; Bent Arrow
asked.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow held up one hand with the
thumb doubled under.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will come so close that we don&rsquo;t dare
leave,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll wait for the
others before they attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can hold them off,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
exclaimed.</p>
<p>He told his uncle of how he had climbed
to the top of the wall. He described the top
and how it would be possible to stay up there
and fire down on the Sioux. If the Sioux tried
to rush the entrance, there were loose rocks
which could be rolled down on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might be able to hold them off,&rdquo;
Flying Arrow agreed, &ldquo;but we have little food.
Soon we shall starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux won&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
insisted. &ldquo;Old-Man-of-the-North will send
more snow. They will leave for their winter
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Sioux will not want to stay,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow admitted, &ldquo;but the disgrace of losing
so fine a herd of horses to one warrior and one
boy will shame them into staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find a way,&rdquo; Bent Arrow insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; Flying Arrow agreed, but there
was little hope in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should rest before the Sioux get
here,&rdquo; Bent Arrow urged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll climb up onto
the ridge and watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop a small stone to waken me when the
Sioux get near,&rdquo; Flying Arrow ordered.</p>
<p>As he walked to the place where he could
climb the wall, Bent Arrow noticed how
small an area of grass there was in the canyon.
Not only would he and his uncle be short of
food if the Sioux besieged them, but the
horses, too, would soon be starving.</p>
<p>When he reached the top of the wall, Bent
Arrow looked around. The Sioux were not
yet in sight. He made his way along the rim
toward the entrance. In most places the rim
was wide enough to easily walk on. There
were a few narrow places where he had to
walk carefully. One short stretch was so narrow
that he had to get to his hands and knees
and crawl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Near the break which formed the entrance,
the rim was wide. A few shrubs were growing
there. These would give him concealment.
He found a few large stones and rolled them
near the edge so they could be dropped on
attackers.</p>
<p>He looked to the east again. He could see
four horsemen approaching. He reached over
to drop a stone to warn Flying Arrow, but
changed his mind. The Sioux were still too far
from the canyon to be a danger and Flying
Arrow needed all the rest he could get. Bent
Arrow stretched out behind a shrub and
watched the Sioux. The riders came on until
they were almost within bowshot. There they
pulled their horses to a stop.</p>
<p>For some reason the Sioux seemed to be
puzzled and uncertain. They drew together in
a group. Evidently they were debating something
concerning the canyon. Several times
one of them waved his arm toward the
entrance. Suddenly, the one who had been
doing most of the talking sent his horse dashing
toward the entrance to the canyon. It was
too late for Bent Arrow to warn his uncle.
Whatever was to be done to stop that Sioux,
Bent Arrow had to do it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Bent Arrow raised his bow and took careful
aim. The rider, stretched low over his horse&rsquo;s
neck, was not a good target, but Bent Arrow
was confident that he would not miss. He
drew the bow taut, but he lowered it without
letting the arrow go. It had come to him why
the Sioux were acting so strangely. They
weren&rsquo;t sure their quarry was still in the
canyon, or if they were in the canyon, whether
or not they were alert. The rider was hardly
within good bowshot when he wheeled his
horse and dashed back to the others.</p>
<p>The Sioux talked together again, often
glancing toward the narrow opening. After a
time, they divided into two pairs, one pair
riding to the left and one to the right. From
the way the warriors watched the ground,
Bent Arrow knew that they were looking for
a trail leading from the canyon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>While the Sioux were searching for a sign
that he and his uncle had escaped, Bent Arrow
dropped a stone to arouse Flying Arrow. It
didn&rsquo;t take the Sioux long to make sure that
the raiders were still in the canyon. The four
warriors returned to a place in front of the
entrance, making sure they were out of range.
They gave the Sioux war cry, but neither Bent
Arrow nor his uncle gave any sign that they
heard it.</p>
<p>The four warriors talked together again.
Two of them left the group, one going to the
right and the other to the left. As though at
a signal, both turned their horses and dashed
toward the entrance. Bent Arrow drew a bead
on the warrior nearest to him, but waited for
Flying Arrow to take the first shot. The warriors
drew together and seemed about to try
to dash through the entrance side by side, and
still Flying Arrow didn&rsquo;t shoot. At the last
moment the two Sioux wheeled their horses
and galloped back to their companions.</p>
<p>All four Sioux dismounted. They turned
their horses loose to graze. Evidently they had
decided to wait until the other warriors joined
them before making an attack on the canyon.
Bent Arrow saw that this would be his chance
to go down and get instructions from his
uncle. He carefully worked his way back to
the place where he had come up the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no attack until the other
Sioux get here,&rdquo; Flying Arrow said when Bent
Arrow joined him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep now and you
can sleep tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I go back up onto the wall?&rdquo; Bent
Arrow asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a better place from which to watch,&rdquo;
Flying Arrow agreed.</p>
<p>As soon as Bent Arrow had returned to his
post, he dropped a stone as a signal. He settled
himself as comfortable as possible. The day
dragged slowly by. As the sun was dropping
down the western sky, two of the Sioux caught
horses and rode away. They soon returned,
dragging large bundles of sticks. Before
sunset they built a fire and hung meat to roast
over it. Occasionally the wind veered and
brought the tantalizing odor of cooking meat
to Bent Arrow.</p>
<p>There was still some daylight when a stone
dropped beside Bent Arrow, signaling that
Flying Arrow wanted him to come down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>As Bent Arrow made his way along the rim
toward the place where he could go down,
he watched the outer wall. He saw one place
where rain water had washed out a small
rough groove. It would be a dangerous way,
but it might be possible to descend there.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow had put out a small piece of
meat for each of them when Bent Arrow got
there. The warrior appeared very discouraged.
He sat with a worried frown creasing his brow
and had little to say. The only time he acted
more cheerful was when he examined the
wound in Bent Arrow&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A night rest and you will forget you had
a wound,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow told of the place he had found
where it might be possible to go down the
outer wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might slip down there and escape
before they missed us,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horses are getting restless,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;If they aren&rsquo;t watched, they&rsquo;ll get
out of the canyon. The Sioux would guess at
once that we were trying to escape. We&rsquo;d be
caught before we were well started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon do you think the other warriors
will get here?&rdquo; Bent Arrow asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Flying Arrow didn&rsquo;t answer. He got to his
feet and went to the narrow passage opening
out of the canyon. Pressing himself against one
wall, he moved ahead and was soon out of
sight. A few moments later he came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to make sure that the Sioux
weren&rsquo;t trying to sneak in here,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re around their campfire. They won&rsquo;t
attack before the other warriors get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Flying Arrow sat with his head
bowed. Bent Arrow had felt encouraged by
his uncle&rsquo;s belief that the Sioux would not
attack for a while. To him, every moment of
delay brought hope that something might
happen to prevent any attack. Yet Flying
Arrow&rsquo;s gloom was beginning to affect him
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t answer your question,&rdquo; Flying
Arrow said, looking up. &ldquo;I believe the other
warriors will be here before daylight, although
I doubt if much of an attack is made. They&rsquo;ll
wait to starve us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could think of some way to get help,&rdquo;
Bent Arrow thought aloud.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow looked up. He started to speak
but changed his mind and shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;You thought of a plan,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was too dangerous,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said we can&rsquo;t escape from here,&rdquo; Bent
Arrow urged. &ldquo;Your plan can&rsquo;t be more dangerous
than staying here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had thought of letting you climb down
the wall after dark,&rdquo; Flying Arrow explained.
&ldquo;It is possible that you could find our hunting
party and bring help in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me try it,&rdquo; Bent Arrow urged.</p>
<p>Flying Arrow remained silent for a long
time. When he did speak, it was with reluctance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a desperate plan and there are many
chances that it won&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yet
there is no chance if we just stay here. After
dark you will climb down the wall and go to
the hunting party&rsquo;s camping place. If they
have started back to winter camp, you are to
follow them until you overtake them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Flying Arrow gave Bent Arrow careful
instructions as to how he was to get to the
camp. He described the landmark which Bent
Arrow would reach which marked the place
where he would turn toward the river. Flying
Arrow ended his instructions by reminding
Bent Arrow that he should travel at the
warrior&rsquo;s pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll climb to your lookout place while
there is still some light,&rdquo; Flying Arrow concluded
his instructions. &ldquo;You can watch the
entrance until I signal that I am ready for
you to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you keep our horses from getting
out of the canyon when you are up there on
the rim?&rdquo; Bent Arrow asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw stones to turn them back whenever
they get near the passage,&rdquo; Flying Arrow
explained.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow crept into the passage as he had
seen his uncle do. He found the niche from
which Flying Arrow had watched the Sioux.
The warriors were seated around the glowing
campfire. Apparently they were waiting for
the rest of their party to arrive before they
made any move against the canyon. Bent
Arrow stayed in his watching place until the
signal stone dropped near him.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Bent Arrow edged into the passage</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Although he had little difficulty climbing
the wall, Bent Arrow lost some time finding
the place where he could go down. When he
did find it, he went carefully, feeling and
testing with each foot before he put any
weight on it. When he was about halfway
down, one foot slipped and he went plunging
down the steep slope. Somehow he managed
to get one foot braced and catch hold with
his hands. He came to a stop.</p>
<p>For a long time he lay there, afraid to shift
his weight lest he go sliding again. At last he
moved one foot and slowly put his weight on
it. Step by step he inched his way down the
slope. At a height greater than a tall man
could reach, he came to a ledge. Below the
ledge the cliff dropped straight down. Bent
Arrow grasped the edge of the ledge, let
himself down to arm&rsquo;s length, and dropped.
He landed easily on his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Without losing time to look around, Bent
Arrow started walking rapidly. He counted his
steps by opening and closing his fingers. When
he had gone a hundred paces, he began to run.
At the end of a hundred running paces, he felt
so fresh and strong that he was tempted to
run another hundred paces, but Flying Arrow&rsquo;s
orders had been definite. He slowed to a walk
for a hundred paces. He continued the alternate
running and walking until he reached the
lone tree of which Flying Arrow had told him.
Here he turned east.</p>
<p>With every step Bent Arrow&rsquo;s confidence
rose. He had escaped the Sioux. He had
traveled at least half of the night, and he felt
as strong as when he had started. He could
hold this pace all the way to the Crow winter
camp if he had to. The thought of having to
travel all the way to the Crow winter camp
brought the first lessening of his confidence.
He had been thinking of the hunting party
as still in the camp where he and Flying Arrow
had left them. But they might not be there.
They might have started to the winter camp.
The thought of Flying Arrow trying to hold
that canyon alone all of the time it would take
to reach the winter camp drained away all of
Bent Arrow&rsquo;s recent confidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>For the first time since he had left the
canyon, Bent Arrow felt fear. He began to
increase his speed, and as the fear mounted he
ran faster until he was running as hard as he
could. It wasn&rsquo;t until he was gasping for air
that he realized his foolishness. He was
exhausting himself. Soon he would drop, and
there would be no one to try to bring help for
Flying Arrow. He slowed to a trot and then
to a walk.</p>
<p>He walked twice the usual distance before
he tried to run again. When he did run, he
found that the hard running he had done
had tired him badly. It took all of his will
power to keep himself running the full
hundred paces. And now he had a new fear.
He might not be able to keep on even to the
river. Yet, somehow he was still going when
dawn broke in the east.</p>
<p>As the prairie became lighter, Bent Arrow
kept on the watch for familiar signs. He had
been across the river several times with warriors.
If he were near it, he should see signs.
Nothing looked familiar. Anxiously he
checked his route with the rising sun. He was
going in the right direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>He was tiring badly. At the end of each
hundred running paces, he was gasping for
breath. He would have to stop and rest, but he
knew he didn&rsquo;t dare. If he stopped, he would
fall asleep. He kept himself going by thinking
of Flying Arrow standing alone against those
Sioux. That helped for a few paces, but at
last he knew he had done his best and had
failed. He was at the foot of some low hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll reach the top before I stop to rest,&rdquo; he
vowed.</p>
<p>He started up the hill. Halfway up he
stumbled and fell. He stretched out and his
eyes closed. A feeling of peace enveloped him
like a warm blanket, but before he fell asleep,
he thought of Flying Arrow. He struggled to his
feet and reeled toward the top.</p>
<p>He fell again. He stayed on his hands and
knees and crawled onward.</p>
<p>Just getting to the top seemed to give him
strength. He stood up. He tried to look ahead,
but weariness had dimmed his eyes so that he
could see only a few paces. He started down
the hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>The horsemen were upon him before he
saw or heard them. He attempted to dodge
aside, but strong arms caught him. Dimly he
realized that one of the men was Clawing
Bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flying Arrow&rsquo;s at Bear Trap Canyon,&rdquo;
Bent Arrow gasped, and collapsed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c11"><br /><i>CHAPTER ELEVEN</i></h2>
<p>When Bent Arrow opened his eyes, he
was lying on a buffalo robe in a tepee.
He sat up uncertainly and gave a little gasp
when he saw Clawing Bear sitting beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did I get here?&rdquo; Bent Arrow
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ran here,&rdquo; Clawing Bear answered
with a smile. &ldquo;As great a run as a Crow ever
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flying Arrow?&rdquo; Bent Arrow asked in a
whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s outside, boasting that his nephew is
the greatest runner in the Crow Nation,&rdquo;
Clawing Bear replied.</p>
<p>Before Clawing Bear had finished speaking,
Flying Arrow entered the tepee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Brother?&rdquo; Flying Arrow
asked.</p>
<p>Bent Arrow stared at his uncle. <i>Brother?</i>
That was the formal word of address Flying
Arrow would have used if he had been speaking
to a warrior. Why should he use that
word?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he come to the corral to see our
horses?&rdquo; Flying Arrow asked, turning to
Clawing Bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will do him good,&rdquo; Clawing Bear
agreed.</p>
<p>As he walked along beside his uncle, Bent
Arrow asked about the rescue. Flying Arrow
told as much of the story as he knew.</p>
<p>He told how he had watched from the rim.
The Sioux on foot had arrived before daylight.
There had been a short powwow and then all
of the Sioux had rolled up in their blankets
to sleep. Knowing that he would need the
rest, and that any small noise would waken
him, Flying Arrow had fallen asleep too. He
had wakened at the first hint of daylight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>The Sioux had attacked a few moments
later. Flying Arrow&rsquo;s two shots knocked two
Sioux warriors from their horses. The Sioux
only took time to pick up their wounded and
then retreated out of bowshot to hold another
conference. From their motioning to one
another, Flying Arrow was able to guess their
next move. They would stay out of bowshot
and sneak up to the canyon wall at some
distance from the entrance. One party would
approach from one side and one from the
other. Flying Arrow might be able to stop one
party, but he couldn&rsquo;t stop both of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you did stop them,&rdquo; Bent Arrow interrupted
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By an accident,&rdquo; Flying Arrow explained.
&ldquo;Two of the horses we had taken wandered
near the opening. I threw stones behind them
and drove them on out. They kept right on
running after they were out of the canyon.
The Sioux postponed their attack while they
caught the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did you keep the other horses from
following the ones which you drove out of
the canyon?&rdquo; Bent Arrow wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I threw stones at them to drive them
back,&rdquo; Flying Arrow answered. &ldquo;But Rock
did most. He soon understood that I didn&rsquo;t
want the others to get out. He stayed near the
entrance and kept the other horses back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flying Arrow went on with his story. He
told how after the Sioux had captured the two
horses they held another council. The warriors
had delayed until the sun had passed
overhead. At last they had prepared to move
to the canyon walls. Before they started, two
mounted warriors were sent around the canyon
walls to scout. One of them came dashing
back, shouting and waving his arms. In a short
time the Sioux had mounted, two to a horse,
and ridden off. Later, the party of Crows came
in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were only seven or eight men in
the Crow party!&rdquo; Bent Arrow exclaimed.
&ldquo;Why did the Sioux run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably they thought more Crows were
coming,&rdquo; Flying Arrow answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>By that time Bent Arrow and his uncle had
reached the corral. Flying Arrow pointed out
the horses which now belonged to Bent
Arrow. There were twelve of them. He was a
rich boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One horse is enough for me,&rdquo; Bent Arrow
protested. &ldquo;You were the warrior in charge.
You deserve all of the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did a warrior&rsquo;s work and you deserve
a warrior&rsquo;s share,&rdquo; Flying Arrow insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trade all of them for Rock,&rdquo; Bent
Arrow offered.</p>
<p>The moment he had spoken, Bent Arrow
wished that he could recall the words. His
uncle had been generous in giving him half
of the horses, far more generous than anyone
would expect him to be. Bent Arrow knew
how ungrateful he must appear. Yet his uncle
didn&rsquo;t seem displeased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come. We must go to our tepee and get
ready to go to the Council Fire,&rdquo; was all that
he said.</p>
<p>As soon as he was in the tepee, Bent Arrow
went to his pile of halters. He selected eight
of the halters and laid them aside. There was
still one question bothering him, and while
he and his uncle were eating, he asked it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember reaching the camp,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;How did I find Clawing Bear and his
men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clawing Bear had a dream that you and
I needed help,&rdquo; Flying Arrow explained.
&ldquo;When the hunting party started back to the
winter camp, he got permission to come to
our aid. The other seven men received
permission to go with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had finished eating, Bent Arrow
added another halter to those he had set aside.
He noticed that Flying Arrow, too, was carrying
halters when they left the tepee.</p>
<p>Clawing Bear and the seven warriors were
seated around the fire. Flying Arrow took his
place in the circle next to Clawing Bear. Bent
Arrow sat behind him. Clawing Bear took
the pipe and lighted it with a brand from the
fire. He blew smoke to the north, the east, the
south, and the west. Then he passed the pipe
to Flying Arrow. Flying Arrow blew smoke in
each of the four directions and passed the pipe
on. In turn, each of the warriors blew smoke
in the four directions. When the pipe came
back to Clawing Bear, he carefully wrapped it
in its cover. The medicine man got to his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seldom do we have the youngest speak
first,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but the youth who made that
great run is entitled to be heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the medicine man sat down, all eyes
turned toward Bent Arrow. Slowly he stood
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle has taught me that good Crows
help each other,&rdquo; he managed to say. &ldquo;You
proved yourselves good Crows by helping us.
I want to give each of you a gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went around the circle giving each warrior
a halter in sign that the warrior now
owned one of Bent Arrow&rsquo;s horses. There
were two halters left in Bent Arrow&rsquo;s hand
when he stopped in front of Clawing Bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two horses to you, Clawing Bear,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;to show you that I am grateful to you
for healing my leg and telling me to get an
eagle feather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a murmur of approval as Bent
Arrow sat down. Flying Arrow got to his feet.
He, too, went around the circle, giving each
man a halter. When he had finished, he still
had one halter in his hand. He turned to Bent
Arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;As a raider,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;you have proved
yourself a good Crow. You have proved yourself
worthy of a good horse. This halter is
Rocks&rsquo;. The horse is yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow tried to thank his uncle, but
there was something wrong with his throat,
and no words would come out. Flying Arrow
turned quickly back to the warriors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clawing Bear will tell you why I made
presents of horses to you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Clawing Bear stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a youth does a great deed,&rdquo; Clawing
Bear spoke solemnly, &ldquo;his nearest relative
is entitled to give gifts and to give the youth
a new name. Twelve summers ago a party of
Sioux injured a Crow boy&mdash;injured him so
badly that the boy could not walk erect and
so was given the name Bent Arrow. Now that
boy has been cured. He has raided a Sioux
camp. He has run a great distance in as short
a time as any Crow has ever run it. When he
reached us, he was ready to drop, but he was
running erectly. I say that the boy, Bent
Arrow, has become the warrior, True Arrow,
a true Crow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>A warrior jumped up and ran around the
circle three times, shouting, &ldquo;Welcome, True
Arrow. Welcome, True Arrow. Welcome,
True Arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bent Arrow, now True Arrow, sat still with
his head down. He was too happy to speak.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
